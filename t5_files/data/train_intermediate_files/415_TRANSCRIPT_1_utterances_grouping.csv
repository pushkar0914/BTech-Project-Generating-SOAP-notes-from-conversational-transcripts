History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. It's a lot to juggle. Have you noticed any changes in how you're managing your stress levels since we last spoke? Yeah, I’ve been trying to practice mindfulness a bit more. I downloaded an app that guides me through some breathing exercises. It helps, especially when I feel overwhelmed. I just take a few minutes to breathe and it calms me down. Absolutely, R&B has a way of connecting with deep emotions. Speaking of emotions, how have you been feeling overall? Any ups and downs? That’s a step in the right direction! What about your interactions with others? You mentioned feeling shorter with people lately. Has that continued? Yeah, I think it has. I’ve been feeling a bit more irritable.  Mostly when I feel overwhelmed with work or school. It’s like I just snap at little things. It feels good, but also a bit scary. What if it doesn’t work out?"
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,Not really. I don’t want to worry them. I just keep it to myself. I guess I just don’t want them to think I’m not coping well. I want to seem strong for them.
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,Nothing reported
Physiological Observations,"That sounds like a good plan. How do you feel about your sleep patterns? Have they improved at all? Not really. I’m still pretty much a zombie. My work schedule is all over the place. I’ve tried to limit my screen time before bed, but it’s hard with work."
Current Functional Status,"We’re still working on it! We just finished a course on property management. It was really informative. I learned a lot about the legal side of things, which was a bit overwhelming but necessary."

Therapeutic Interventions,It sounds like finding ways to manage your stress could be beneficial. Would you be open to practicing some assertive communication techniques to express your feelings instead of snapping? Fantastic! We can work on that together. It might help you express yourself without feeling like you’re losing control. 
Next Steps,"Yeah, I see that. Maybe I’ll try to bring it up next time we talk. It can definitely be a challenge. Perhaps we could explore some other strategies together, or even set a goal for you to try this week? Great! How about setting a specific bedtime for yourself? Even if it’s just 15 minutes earlier than usual, it could help. That sounds good. I want to be more mindful of how I communicate. I like that idea. I guess I could think about the possibilities instead of just the risks. I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about taking small steps towards your goals. What’s one small action you can take this week to move closer to your dream? Maybe I’ll start researching properties more seriously. I could set aside some time this weekend. I’m glad to hear that. You’ve made some great insights today. Let’s plan to check in on your progress next time. "
