Therapeutic Interventions,That’s a good point. Maybe I could share it with a friend first. It’s understandable. Would it help to create a list of affirmations or reminders that you can refer to during those times? Let’s brainstorm a few together. How about starting with “I am capable of creating and sharing my stories”? Great! You could also include “I am allowed to feel my emotions and take things one step at a time.”  Would you like to write these down and add to them over time?
Next Steps,Maybe I could join a writing group or workshop. That sounds like an excellent idea! Engaging with others can provide support and encouragement. Would you like to research some options before our next session?
