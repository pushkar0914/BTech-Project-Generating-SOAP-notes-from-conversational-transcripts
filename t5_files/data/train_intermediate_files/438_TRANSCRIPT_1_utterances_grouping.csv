History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, just trying to keep everything balanced with the kids and school. That sounds like a lot to juggle. Have you had any moments where you felt particularly stressed or overwhelmed? Yeah, definitely. There were a few days where I felt like I was just running on empty, especially with the kids' activities and my school assignments piling up. How did you cope with those feelings? I tried to take some time for myself, even if it was just a few minutes to breathe or meditate. But honestly, it was tough to find that time. It sounds like you're aware of the importance of self-care. Have you been able to incorporate any new strategies since we last talked? I’ve been trying to go to the beach more often. Just sitting there helps clear my mind. That’s a great idea! Nature can be very grounding. How did it feel to spend that time at the beach? It felt refreshing. I could just watch the waves and forget about everything for a moment. That’s wonderful to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your mood after those beach visits? Yes, I feel calmer and more centered. It’s like a reset button for me. That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’re finding effective ways to manage stress. Have you been able to share your feelings with your friends or family? I’ve talked to my friend a bit, but sometimes I feel like I don’t want to burden them with my problems. It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you considered how sharing might strengthen those relationships? I guess it could, but I worry they might not understand.  That’s a valid concern. What if you approached it from a place of wanting to connect, rather than just sharing your burdens? That could work. Maybe I should focus on how they can support me rather than just venting. Exactly! It can be a collaborative conversation. Speaking of support, how is your schoolwork going? It’s been challenging, but I’m keeping up. Some subjects are tougher than others. Which subjects do you find most challenging? Business is a bit hard for me. I’m trying to grasp all the concepts, but sometimes it feels overwhelming. They’re doing well, but my oldest is starting to push back a little more. It’s a bit challenging. That’s common during the teenage years. How have you been handling that? I try to talk to him, but sometimes it feels like he shuts down. Great! And how do you feel when he shuts down? Frustrated, mostly. I just want to understand him better."

Next Steps,"Have you thought about forming a study group with classmates? That’s a good idea! I haven’t thought of that. I usually study alone. Studying with others can provide different perspectives and make learning more enjoyable. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to classmates? I think so. I just need to find the right people to connect with. That’s a great start! You have a lot of strengths in communication, so I believe you’d do well in that environment.  Thanks, I appreciate that. I’ll give it a try. Have you considered asking him open-ended questions to encourage him to share more? I haven’t really tried that. I usually just ask him how his day was. Open-ended questions can invite deeper conversations. For example, asking what he enjoyed most about his day might open up more dialogue. That makes sense. I’ll give it a shot. It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you tried expressing that to him? No, I haven’t. I guess I could let him know that I just want to be there for him. That could help him feel more comfortable opening up. It might reassure him that you’re on his side. I’ll definitely try that. Thanks for the suggestion. You’re welcome! It sounds like you’re making some solid plans. What’s one goal you’d like to focus on before our next session? I’d like to work on my communication with my son and maybe reach out to classmates for study help. Those sound like excellent goals! How about we check in on your progress with those in our next session?"
