Next Steps,"That’s a common experience. It’s good that you’re falling asleep faster, but let’s work on strategies to help you stay asleep longer. Would you be open to that?  One approach is to limit screen time before bed and avoid caffeine in the afternoon. Have you tried that?  Reducing caffeine can have a significant impact on sleep. Would you consider swapping it for herbal tea?  I think I need to remind myself of that when I face new challenges.  Exactly! You could set small, achievable goals to build your confidence. Would you like to brainstorm some ideas for your project?  I guess I could start by writing a few posts and sharing them with friends for feedback.  Let’s set a goal for you to write your first post by our next session. How does that sound? "
