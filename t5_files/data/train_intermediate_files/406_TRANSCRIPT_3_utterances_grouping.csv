History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been really helpful. I set reminders on my phone, and it’s made a difference when I start to feel stressed. Yeah, I had a big assignment due, and I felt really overwhelmed. I took a few minutes to breathe, and it helped me focus. I felt relieved! And I was proud of myself for not letting the stress take over. Definitely! I feel more balanced and less anxious about school and work. I guess I’m still feeling a little uncertain about my future career path. I’m worried about making the wrong choice. I just don’t want to end up in a job I don’t enjoy or that doesn’t fulfill me. I think it means helping others and feeling like I’m making a difference. Volunteering at the community center has been fulfilling. I like seeing people improve and feel supported."

Physiological Observations,"Hi, Ellie! It’s been pretty good. I’ve been keeping up with my walks and practicing deep breathing."
Current Functional Status,I’ve been looking into workshops on counseling skills. I think it would be a good way to learn more. There’s one coming up on active listening and empathy. I think it would be really beneficial.

Next Steps,"That sounds perfect for you! Would you like to set a goal to attend that workshop? Yes, I’d love to! I’ll sign up for it this week. I guess I could focus on roles that involve direct support, like counseling or teaching. That sounds like a solid plan! Exploring those areas further could help you feel more confident about your choices. Would you like to set a goal to research more about those roles this week? Yes, I can do that. I’ll look into what qualifications I need and what the job market looks like."
