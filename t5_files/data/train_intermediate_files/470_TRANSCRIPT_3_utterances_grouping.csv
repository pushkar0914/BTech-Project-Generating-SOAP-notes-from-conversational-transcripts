History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay. I practiced mindfulness and reached out to some contacts. I got a response from one of my classmates, and they mentioned a job opening at a daycare! I feel hopeful, but I’m also nervous about applying. I guess I worry that I won’t be good enough for the position. I’ve been trying to focus on the positives, but some days are still tough. I think we’re getting closer. I’m more present with her, and I try to listen more. I want to be more patient with her when she gets upset."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I could look at my list of accomplishments or repeat my affirmations before applying. One technique is deep breathing. When you feel yourself getting frustrated, taking a moment to breathe can help you respond calmly. Would you like to practice that together?"
Next Steps,"Absolutely! Practicing that can help you pause before reacting. Would you like to set a goal to practice this technique when you feel overwhelmed? Yes, that sounds good. I’ll try to remember to breathe before reacting."
