History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay, I guess. A bit overwhelmed still, but managing. That’s understandable. You mentioned feeling trapped and helpless last time. Have those feelings changed at all? A little bit. I’ve been trying to focus on what I can control, but it’s still tough. It feels good! Even if it’s just a small thing, it gives me a little boost. But then I still have those moments where I feel overwhelmed by everything else. I tend to push it down and just keep going, but I know that’s not healthy. I’ve done some meditation in the past, but I haven’t really kept up with it. Yeah, they’ve been pretty intense lately. I wake up feeling anxious. A lot of them are about feeling unprepared or out of control. Like I’m in a situation where I can’t find my way. I guess I’m just worried about the future. It feels uncertain. I try to remind myself to take things one day at a time, but sometimes that doesn’t work."

Therapeutic Interventions,Would you be open to incorporating mindfulness practices into your routine? It could help with managing those overwhelming feelings. Perhaps you could start with just a few minutes each day? Even five minutes can be beneficial.
Next Steps,"That sounds doable. I can try to set a reminder for myself. I could look into some online courses or networking events. I’ve been avoiding those because I’m not sure where to start. That’s a great idea! Taking small steps towards your goals can help alleviate that feeling of being unprepared. Would you like to set a specific goal around that for the next week? Sure! I’ll aim to sign up for one online course by our next session. It’s important to remember that friends and family often want to support you. Sharing your feelings might help lighten the load. Would you consider reaching out to someone this week? Yeah, I think I could do that. I’ll try to talk to a friend. Of course! I’m here to support you. Let’s plan to explore your feelings about the future more in our next session. "
