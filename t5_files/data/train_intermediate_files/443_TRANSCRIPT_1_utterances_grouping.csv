History of Present Illness (HPI),"Uh, it’s been slow. I applied to a few places, but no responses yet. Uh, a bit anxious, I guess. I just want to find something soon. I could look into that. I used to enjoy art classes. Um, still a bit up and down. Some days are better than others. I think when I see friends posting about their lives online, it gets to me sometimes. Not really. I still feel like there’s stuff I wish I’d done differently. I guess I regret not sticking with school. I didn’t feel like I was good enough.  I think it makes me doubt myself a lot. Like, I’m not capable of doing anything."

Next Steps,Absolutely! Let’s work on that this week. Keep a journal of those moments when you feel capable or proud. We can discuss it in our next session.
