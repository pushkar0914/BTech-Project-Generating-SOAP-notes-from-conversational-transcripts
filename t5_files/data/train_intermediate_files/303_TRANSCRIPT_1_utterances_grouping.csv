History of Present Illness (HPI),"I actually started the classes last week! It’s been a bit overwhelming, but I think it’s good for me. Just balancing everything, you know? Between work, the kids, and school, I feel like I’m juggling a lot. Definitely when I’m trying to help my daughter. It’s like I want to support her, but she doesn’t always listen. I try to be patient, but sometimes I end up getting frustrated when she doesn’t take my advice. I think she’d appreciate it. Sometimes she just wants to vent, and I jump in with solutions before she’s done talking. I think spending more quality time together could help. Maybe we could do something fun together, just the two of us. She loves going to the park. Maybe we could have a picnic or something. I think it’s my mind racing with everything I have to do. Sometimes I just can’t turn it off."

Progress Evaluation,"Yeah, I feel a bit more relaxed afterward. It’s like a reset for me. Maybe I could listen more instead of just giving advice. I guess she needs to feel heard too. I think that could work. It might help her feel understood."
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to meditate more, and I make sure to take those long walks when I can. It helps clear my head. That’s a common tendency. Practicing active listening could help strengthen your relationship. Would you like to try some techniques for that? Great! One technique is to reflect back what she says. For example, if she expresses frustration, you could say, “It sounds like you’re feeling really overwhelmed.” How does that sound to you?"
Next Steps,"That sounds lovely! Making those memories can strengthen your bond. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for this week? I’d like that. I’ll try to plan something for us. Consistency can really help. Would you be open to establishing a calming bedtime routine? Great! Perhaps you could set a specific time to start winding down, like an hour before bed. You could read or do some gentle stretching. How does that sound? That sounds doable. I’ll give it a try."
