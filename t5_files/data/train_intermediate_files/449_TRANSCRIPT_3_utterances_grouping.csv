History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing well, thanks! I’ve been practicing yoga and meditation regularly. Yes, I feel more patient with my kids. I’m not as quick to react, which helps a lot during our discussions. We’ve been able to talk about more personal things without me getting defensive. I think she appreciates that I’m listening more. Sometimes, she still shuts down. I try to give her space, but I worry if I’m doing the right thing. We’ve had a few more dinners together, and he seems more comfortable talking about his life. Mostly his job and some of his future plans. It’s nice to hear him share his thoughts. Yes, he seems more relaxed and open. I think he’s starting to trust that I’m not judging him. I feel more confident. I’m learning to embrace the ups and downs, and I’m more forgiving of myself. I think it’s the combination of self-care and being open to learning. I’m realizing that it’s okay to not have all the answers."

Next Steps,"I think I’ll just let her know that I’m here whenever she’s ready to talk. I don’t want to push her. I guess I’m just curious about how to maintain this balance moving forward. It feels good, and I want to keep it up. Maybe I could set a goal to have one-on-one time with each of my kids weekly, along with my self-care routine."
