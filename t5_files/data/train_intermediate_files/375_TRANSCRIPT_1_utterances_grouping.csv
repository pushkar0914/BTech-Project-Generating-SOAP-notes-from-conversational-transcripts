History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been doing okay, I guess. Trying to stay positive like we talked about.   That’s good to hear! Have you noticed any specific changes in your mood or thoughts?   Yeah, I’ve been trying to focus on the good things more.   Well, I went to the beach last weekend, and it felt really nice to just relax and enjoy the sun.   A little bit. I painted a small piece last week.   It felt really good. I missed it.   Just the colors of the sunset. I wanted to capture that feeling.   It definitely lifts my spirits.   That’s great to hear. Have you noticed if there are any barriers that prevent you from creating more often?   Sometimes I feel like I don’t have enough time, or I get stuck on what to create.   We talked a bit about our argument. I think we’re in a better place now.   I just tried to be more understanding of his stress.   A little. I think we’re getting there.   A little bit.

Psychosocial History,"Just walked along the shore with my wife. We talked about our future plans.   We’re thinking about traveling more, maybe even moving to a different state.

Therapeutic Interventions,"That sounds like a solid plan. And if you get stuck on ideas, we can brainstorm together.   It could be helpful. Maybe we can work on some strategies for that.   Excellent! We can explore different techniques that might resonate with you.  "
Next Steps,Time can be a challenge. What if we set a small goal for you to create something each week?   That could work. Maybe I could set aside a couple of hours on the weekend.   Fantastic! Let’s continue to build on that. Would you be open to trying a guided meditation together next session?
