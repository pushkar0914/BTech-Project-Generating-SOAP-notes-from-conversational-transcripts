History of Present Illness (HPI),"It felt really good to finally get it done. I was so nervous, but I did it! Not yet, but I’m trying to be patient. It went better than I expected. They were really understanding and said they didn’t realize I felt that way. I feel relieved. I think we’re all going to work on connecting more. I’ve been thinking about my anxiety again, especially with the job search. It’s normal to feel anxious about the future. Have you noticed any specific triggers for your anxiety? I think it’s mostly when I think about not being good enough or not getting a job. I thought, “I won’t get any of these internships.”"

Therapeutic Interventions,"Those thoughts can be overwhelming. Would you be open to practicing some cognitive-behavioral techniques to challenge those thoughts? Yes, I’d like to try that.
