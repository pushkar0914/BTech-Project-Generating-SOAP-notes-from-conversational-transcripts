History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing well, thanks! I’ve been practicing my breathing exercises.   That’s wonderful! How has that impacted your stress levels?   I feel more in control, especially at work.   That’s fantastic to hear! Have you noticed any specific situations where it helped?   Yes, during a big meeting last week. I felt anxious, but I used the breathing technique.   That’s a great application of what we’ve discussed. How did it feel to manage your anxiety in that moment?   Empowering! I felt like I was in charge.   I sometimes feel unappreciated, like my efforts go unnoticed.   Yeah, it does. I sometimes feel like why bother if no one notices.   Not really. I guess I’ve been waiting for recognition.   I could do that. I just worry about coming off as bragging.  "
