History of Present Illness (HPI),"Oh, it went really well! We had our premiere last week, and the audience seemed to really enjoy it.   Honestly, it felt amazing. I was really proud of the work we put into it.   Definitely. There were moments when I thought we wouldn't finish in time, and I was stressed about it.   I’ve been thinking a lot about how to balance my work and family time.   Sometimes work gets overwhelming, and I end up bringing stress home with me.   I’m thinking about a documentary this time. I want to explore a local issue.   I want to focus on homelessness in our area. It’s a pressing issue that needs more attention.  "

Progress Evaluation,"I think I’m getting better at it. I’m more aware of when I start to feel overwhelmed.   It's been a bit better actually. I’ve been trying to be more patient with her.   It’s been helpful, but I still struggle with it sometimes.   I’m feeling more motivated than ever. I want to keep making films.   I’m a bit nervous about it, but I think it’s worth it.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I tried to take breaks and remind myself to breathe. Sometimes I even went for a walk to clear my head.   I’ve been focusing on listening to her more and understanding her perspective.   I’ve started setting specific work hours and trying to leave my work at the office.   Maybe I could create a ritual to signal the end of my workday.   I thought about taking a short walk after work or listening to a specific song.   I want to interview people who are experiencing it and share their stories.   Yes, I want to be sensitive and make sure they feel comfortable sharing.   I think I’ll do more research and maybe talk to other filmmakers who have done similar projects.   I’ll reach out to some local filmmakers I know.  "
Next Steps,I’d like to focus on my documentary and how I can manage my time better between work and family.
