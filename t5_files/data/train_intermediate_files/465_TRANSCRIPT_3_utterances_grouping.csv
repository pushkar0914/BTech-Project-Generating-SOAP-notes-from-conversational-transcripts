Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,Hey! I’ve been doing pretty well. I performed at the open mic night! I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about my friendships lately.
Trauma History,Nothing reported

History of Present Illness (HPI),"It was awesome! I was nervous at first, but once I got on stage, it felt great. I want to keep performing and maybe start recording some tracks. I’ve set aside some time this week to start working on a demo. I’m excited but also a bit nervous. I want it to be perfect. I feel like I’m growing and changing, but some friends want to stay in the same routine."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Just the energy from the crowd. They were really into it, and it felt like we were all connected. It felt liberating. I love expressing myself that way. I want to capture my sound and share my story. It’s important to me. For sure. I want to enjoy the process."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I think I’ll just take breaks and not rush things.  I guess I just need to be honest about where I’m at. Okay, like, “Hey, I value our friendship, but I feel like I’m changing and want to talk about it?” It feels good. I think I can do that."
Next Steps,Thanks! I’ll try to have that conversation soon.
