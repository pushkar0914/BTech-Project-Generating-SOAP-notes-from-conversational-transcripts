History of Present Illness (HPI),"I think so. I feel a little more motivated and less anxious. It’s nice to have a routine again. Yeah, I did. I told her how I was feeling about my job search and how I was worried about being a burden. It felt good. I was worried she’d think differently of me, but it was a relief to be honest. Sometimes it’s just the pressure of being in a new environment. I worry about making mistakes. I feel like I’m starting to regain some confidence. I’m learning new things and it feels good. I think it’ll help. I’m starting to feel less insecure about my past, and that’s a relief."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I have! I’ve been trying to take a few minutes each day to focus on my breathing, especially when I feel overwhelmed. It helps, especially when I start feeling anxious at work. I just take a moment to breathe and it calms me down. A little, but I’ve been able to manage it better. I just remind myself to breathe and let it go. Yeah, I had a day where everything felt too much, but I took a break and went for a walk. That helped clear my head. I’m trying to be more mindful of my feelings, you know?"
Next Steps,I want to keep building my confidence at work and maybe start looking into culinary courses. Let’s set that as a goal for our next session. You can research some courses and see what interests you.
