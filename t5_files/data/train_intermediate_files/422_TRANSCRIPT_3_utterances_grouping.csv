History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been doing better, actually! I reached out to my family.   It went really well. They were supportive, and it felt good to talk.   Yeah, it made me feel less isolated.   Yes! I set aside some time, and it was really relaxing.   It felt freeing. I forgot about my worries for a bit.   I want to keep it up.   Right. I’ve also been trying to incorporate more walks into my routine.   I still have my low moments, but they’re not as frequent.   I try to remind myself of the good moments or do something I enjoy.   I think they often come when I’m really tired or stressed.   I’ve been trying to meditate a little bit each day.  "
