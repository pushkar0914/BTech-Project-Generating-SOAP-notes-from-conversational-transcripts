Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,I’d like to talk about how to handle stress when things get overwhelming. I sometimes struggle with that.
Trauma History,Nothing reported
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been doing well, thanks. I actually tried writing down my thoughts before bed, and it helped a lot! It felt freeing, like I could let go of the worries for the night. I didn’t feel as anxious about the next day. I feel calmer and more present. It helps me when I start to feel overwhelmed with everything. When the baby is crying, and I have a lot to do, I feel like I can’t handle it all. I haven’t really. I just tend to freeze up and feel panic."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I did! I told her about my courses and how I’m feeling. She was really supportive and offered to help with the baby when I study. It felt good! I think it brought us closer, and I felt less alone in my journey."
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,Nothing reported
Physiological Observations,"Yes, I think I slept better overall. I still have some nights where it’s tough, but it’s improving. I feel more energized during the day, which is nice. I’m able to be more present with my baby, too."
Current Functional Status,"I did! I took a short walk by myself while my husband watched the baby. It felt nice to have that break. I think I need to make it a regular thing. It really helps me recharge. Yes! I enrolled in a couple of online modules, and I’ve started my first one. It’s challenging but exciting! It’s a lot of information, but I’m enjoying it. I feel like I’m learning so much already."

Progress Evaluation,Nothing reported

Therapeutic Interventions,"I tried the breathing exercises we did together, and I actually liked it! I do it for a few minutes every day now. One technique you could try is grounding yourself. When you start to feel overwhelmed, take a moment to focus on your breath and remind yourself of your surroundings."
Next Steps,"I’d love to read a book I’ve been meaning to get into. I’ll make some time for that! Not yet, but I’m thinking about joining a discussion forum to meet others. That sounds manageable. I’ll give it a try! That sounds helpful. I could try that when things get chaotic. Yes, I’ll work on it. Thank you!"
