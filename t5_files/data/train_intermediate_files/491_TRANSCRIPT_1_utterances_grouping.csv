Trauma History,Nothing reported
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"I leaned on my friends a lot. They were really supportive. Just being there made a difference. Yeah, I tried to focus on the good memories rather than the sadness. It helped to talk about the happy times we had. Honestly, a bit drained. I think it’s hitting me more now that the event is over.  It’s tough sometimes. I find myself getting really invested in the cases we discuss, especially the ones involving children. Definitely. I sometimes take those stories home with me, and it can be overwhelming. I’ve been thinking about my family a lot, especially after the funeral."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Sure. I feel like there are unresolved issues with my siblings. We don’t talk much, and it bothers me."
Risk Assessment,I guess I fear it might just lead to more conflict. Nervous but also hopeful. It's been a while since we connected.
Mental Health Observations,I can feel myself relaxing a bit. A little lighter. I think I could use this more often.
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,"Not really. School is picking up, and I'm just trying to keep my head above water. We're working on family law right now, which is interesting but also heavy."

Progress Evaluation,Nothing reported
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"We could explore some techniques together. For instance, practicing mindfulness or setting boundaries around study time might help. What do you think? It can be a great way to stay present and manage overwhelming feelings. Would you like to try a simple mindfulness exercise together now? Okay, let’s take a moment to focus on your breathing. Inhale deeply through your nose… and exhale through your mouth.  As you breathe, notice how your body feels. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath."
Next Steps,"Absolutely! It’s a practice that takes time to develop. Would you like to set a goal to incorporate mindfulness into your routine? Yes, maybe I could start with five minutes a day. That sounds like a realistic goal. How do you feel about tracking your progress? I think I’ll write it down in my planner. It helps me stay accountable. I’m not sure. Maybe starting with something light, like asking how they’ve been? That sounds like a good start. Keeping it light can help ease into deeper conversations later. Would you like to set a goal to reach out to them? Yes, I think I will. I’ll try to call my sister this week. I’m glad to hear that! Remember to practice mindfulness, and I look forward to hearing how your conversation with your sister goes next time."
