History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I had a few good days where I felt more motivated. But then I had a couple of rough days where I felt really low.   I think it was just a mix of stress from work and feeling overwhelmed with everything going on in my life.   Yeah, I noticed that I often write about feeling inadequate or comparing myself to others.   I guess I just feel like I should be doing more with my life. Sometimes I see friends achieving things, and I feel stuck.   I tend to withdraw and isolate myself when I feel that way.   Not really. I usually just keep it to myself.   Not in a while. I’ve been so busy with work and everything.   Mostly just worries about work and my future.   It’s been tough. I feel like I’m not making the impact I want to.   I think it’s a mix of my own self-doubt and the limitations of the tutoring job.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"A little bit. I've been journaling more, and it does help sometimes.   Mostly my feelings and some of the things that have been bothering me. It helps to get it out of my head.   I’ve been trying to meditate before bed, but sometimes my mind just races.  "
Next Steps,"I could try that. Maybe talking to someone would help.   How about setting a goal to have a chat with her this week?   That would be nice. I’ll try to make time for that.   Meditation can be tricky, especially if your mind is busy. Would you be interested in exploring some guided meditation resources?   Yes, that could be helpful.   It might help to get those thoughts out on paper. You could even write a short list of things you can address tomorrow.   That sounds like a good idea. I’ll give it a try.   I’d love to get back into teaching full-time. I miss it.   I could start looking for teaching positions and maybe take some workshops to improve my skills.   Those sound like actionable steps! Would you like to set a timeline for that?   Yes, I think I could aim to start looking by next month.   That sounds like a solid plan. Let’s check in on that next session.  "
