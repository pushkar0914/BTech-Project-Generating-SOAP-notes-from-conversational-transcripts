History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I found a few job openings that I applied for, but I haven't heard back yet. It’s been a bit stressful. I try to keep busy, but sometimes I just feel anxious and start overthinking everything. I worry about my future and if I’ll ever find a stable job. I also think about how long it’s been since I graduated, and I feel like I'm falling behind. I think they’re valid, but they can be overwhelming. Sometimes I feel like I’m not doing enough."

Current Functional Status,I sometimes listen to music or talk to my sister about how I’m feeling. I love R&B and pop. They really lift my mood. I haven’t really thought about that. I usually just sing in the shower.

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to practice mindfulness and focus on the present, but I still struggle with it. Mindfulness can be a great tool. Would you like to explore some specific mindfulness exercises together? Great! One simple exercise is focusing on your breath. When you feel anxious, you can take a few deep breaths and count to four as you inhale and exhale. Would you like to try it now? Alright, let’s take a deep breath in… 1, 2, 3, 4… and out… 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel for you? It felt calming. I can see how it helps to just focus on my breath."
Next Steps,"I’d like to talk more about managing my anxiety, especially with job searching. That’s a great goal. We can explore more coping strategies and perhaps role-play some job interview scenarios. How does that sound?"
