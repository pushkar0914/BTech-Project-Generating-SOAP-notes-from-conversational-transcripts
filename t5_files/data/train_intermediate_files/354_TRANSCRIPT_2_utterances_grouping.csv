History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been okay. I tried waking up earlier like we talked about. It was tough at first, but I think it helped a bit. I felt less rushed in the mornings. I was less stressed, and I had time to eat breakfast, which made a difference. Mostly, but I still struggle on days when I have to work early. Yes! I played a few times with some friends. It felt really good. It made me feel happier and more energized. I’ve been trying the bedtime routine, but I still have some rough nights. The stretching helps a bit, but I still have trouble shutting my mind off."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Mindfulness can be really beneficial. Would you like to try a simple breathing exercise together now? Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose… and out through your mouth. Focus on the breath. In… and out.  As you breathe, let go of any tension in your body. Just focus on this moment. I’m glad! Practicing this for a few minutes each night could help ease your mind. Would you be willing to try that?"
Next Steps,"I’d like to try joining a local league or something. Just to get back into it. Not yet, but I’ll check it out. Yes, I’ll give it a shot."
