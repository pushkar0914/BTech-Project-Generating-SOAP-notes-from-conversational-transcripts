History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. Last time we talked about some feelings of being down and your job situation. Have there been any changes in those areas? Not really. Still looking for work, but it’s tough out there. That sounds frustrating. Have you had any interviews or opportunities since we last spoke? A couple, but nothing really came of them. Just feels like I’m going in circles. I can see how that would be discouraging. How do you cope with those feelings when they come up? I try to keep myself busy, but sometimes it just gets overwhelming. It’s important to acknowledge that feeling. Have you tried any specific activities to help with that? I’ve been playing with my dog more. That helps a bit. That’s wonderful! Spending time with pets can be very therapeutic. How does it make you feel when you play with your dog? It makes me happy, like I can forget about everything else for a while. That’s great to hear. It sounds like a good coping strategy. Have you thought about incorporating more activities like that into your routine? Yeah, I guess I should. Just sometimes it feels like I don’t have the energy. That’s understandable. Sometimes, when we feel low, even the things we enjoy can feel like a chore. Would you be open to discussing some small steps to help you feel more energized? Wonderful. Let’s also talk about your eating patterns. You mentioned feeling restless and moody. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite since we last spoke? How about your sleep? You mentioned it was alright last time. Any changes there?"

Therapeutic Interventions,"Great! What about setting aside just 10-15 minutes a day to play with your dog or go for a short walk? It could help lift your mood. That can be tough. Have you thought about trying to eat smaller, more frequent meals to see if that helps? It might be worth experimenting with. Eating regularly can sometimes help stabilize our mood too.  That sounds frustrating. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed to help you wind down? Watching TV can be relaxing, but sometimes it can also be stimulating. Would you be open to trying something like reading or listening to calming music before bed?"
Next Steps,"That sounds doable. I can try that. I haven’t really, but I guess I could give it a shot. I could try that. I used to read a lot before sleeping. That’s a good idea! It might help prepare your mind for sleep. Let’s set that as a goal for this week, along with the dog time and eating more frequently. I agree! Let’s check in again next week to see how those goals went. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take small steps."
