History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hmm, I think I’ve been more aware of it. Like, I had a situation last week where I didn’t get a job I applied for, and instead of getting angry, I tried to talk myself through it. It felt a bit freeing, honestly. I told myself that it just wasn’t the right fit, and I’d find something better.  Well, there was a minor incident with my friend. We got into a disagreement about plans, and instead of blowing up, I just took a moment to breathe and express how I felt calmly. They were surprised at first but appreciated it. We talked it out and ended up laughing about it later. Yes! I think it’s making my friendships feel more stable. I used to worry that my anger would push people away. Well, I still struggle with feeling dependent on others, especially in relationships. I find it hard to let go sometimes. I guess it’s fear of being alone. I’ve always had people around me, and the thought of being on my own is scary. I haven’t really thought about it. It’s more about the feeling of emptiness, I think. I could try painting or writing. I used to enjoy those things before life got busy. It would feel nice, I think. Like I’d be reconnecting with a part of myself I’ve neglected."

Mental Health Observations,"I felt lighter, I guess. Like, I didn’t carry that weight of disappointment for too long."
Physiological Observations,"Hi! Well, I’ve been okay, I guess. The cold is still lingering, but I’m managing.  I’m still waking up a lot, especially with this cold. The NyQuil helps, but I know it’s not a long-term solution. I haven’t really tried anything specific. Just watching TV until I fall asleep."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I did some chanting, which helped calm me down. I also took a walk to clear my head. That’s a valuable insight. Perhaps we can work on reframing your thoughts about solitude. It could be an opportunity for self-discovery and growth. Watching TV can be stimulating. What if you tried some gentle stretching or meditation before bed? That sounds like a good idea. I’ve heard meditation can help with sleep. Absolutely! It can calm the mind and prepare your body for rest. Would you like to try a short guided meditation together now?"
Next Steps,I like that idea. I’ll try to dedicate some time for that.
