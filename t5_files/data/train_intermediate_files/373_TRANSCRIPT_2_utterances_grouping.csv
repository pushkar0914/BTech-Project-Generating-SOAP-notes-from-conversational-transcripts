History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing better, actually. I’ve been practicing the techniques we talked about. That’s fantastic to hear! How has your experience been with challenging those negative thoughts? It’s been helpful. I’ve caught myself in those moments and used the evidence to counter them. It’s made a difference. I’m so glad to hear that! Have you noticed any changes in your anxiety levels since incorporating those strategies? Yes, I think I’m feeling a little less anxious about my work. I still have moments, but they’re not as overwhelming. That’s a significant step forward! Have you had any specific situations where you applied these techniques? I had a meeting with the artists I’m working with, and I felt nervous beforehand. I used the technique to remind myself of my past successes, and it helped me stay calm. It felt validating. I realized I can do this, and it’s nice to see my hard work paying off. Absolutely! Celebrating those successes is important. Have you been able to manage your nighttime anxiety as well? That’s great to hear! Mindfulness can be a powerful tool for relaxation. Have you noticed any particular thoughts that still come up at night? Sometimes I still worry about what I need to do the next day, but I try to redirect my focus to my breath instead."

Psychosocial History,"I’ve been thinking about my relationship with my girlfriend. I miss her a lot when she’s away. That’s understandable. Long-distance can be challenging. How are you coping with the distance? I’ve been trying to stay connected through video calls and texts, but it’s not the same as being together. It’s definitely tough. Have you found any ways to make those calls feel more special or meaningful? We’ve started watching movies together over video calls, which has been nice. It makes me feel closer to her. It makes me feel more connected to her, like we’re still part of each other’s lives despite the distance. That’s beautiful. Maintaining that emotional connection is vital in long-distance relationships. Have you discussed your feelings about the distance with her? I have, and she understands. She misses me too, but we both know it’s temporary. It’s great that you can communicate openly about your feelings. That can strengthen your relationship even more. How do you feel about the future of your relationship? I’m hopeful. I think we both want to make it work, and I believe we will."
