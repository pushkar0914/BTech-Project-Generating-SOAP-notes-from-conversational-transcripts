History of Present Illness (HPI),"I'm glad to hear that! Last time we talked, you mentioned feeling shy in social situations. Have you had any opportunities to practice being more outgoing? A little bit, actually. I went to a small gathering with some friends, and I tried to engage more in conversations. It was a bit uncomfortable, but I pushed myself. It felt rewarding, but I still felt that anxiety creeping in. I was worried about saying the wrong thing. Absolutely! It can really help manage anxiety. Speaking of anxiety, you mentioned waking up multiple times during the night. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep since we last spoke? Wonderful! Let’s also revisit your relationship with your best friend. You mentioned having a conflict last time. Have you had a chance to talk to her since then? Yes, we did. I reached out and apologized for my part in the argument, and we talked it out."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One technique we can try is cognitive restructuring, where we challenge those anxious thoughts. For example, when you think, ""What if I say something silly?"" we can reframe it to, ""It's okay to make mistakes; everyone does."" How does that sound? Great! We can also practice some mindfulness exercises. Focusing on your breath can help ground you in the moment. Would you be open to trying a short breathing exercise now? It might be helpful to establish a bedtime routine that doesn’t involve screens. Maybe reading or listening to calming music could help signal to your brain that it’s time to wind down. That’s a valuable goal. We can explore some techniques for improving patience, like mindfulness and communication strategies. "
Next Steps,Fantastic! How about we set a goal for you to try this new bedtime routine at least three times before our next session?
