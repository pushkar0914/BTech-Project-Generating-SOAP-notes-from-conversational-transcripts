History of Present Illness (HPI),um it's pretty hard there's a lot of competition <laughter> it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life  sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me  um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter>  um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it
Medical and Psychiatric History,no no <clears throat>  yes gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago um not currently i i did about like six months ago um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do

Risk Assessment,um pretty good i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion 
Mental Health Observations,Nothing reported
Physiological Observations,um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat> um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter>
Current Functional Status,Nothing reported
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat>
