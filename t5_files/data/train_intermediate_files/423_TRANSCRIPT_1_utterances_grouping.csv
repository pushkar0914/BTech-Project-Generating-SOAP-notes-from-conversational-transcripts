History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, a bit stressed, but managing. I'm glad to hear you're managing. Last time, you mentioned feeling a little stressed. What do you think has been causing that stress for you? Just the usual things, you know? Job searching and trying to figure out my next steps. I applied to a few places, but I haven't heard back yet. It's a bit disheartening. I try to keep myself busy, but sometimes I just feel anxious about it. Sometimes, but other times it feels like my mind just races. I tried it a few times, but I never kept it up. I’ve been trying to let go, but it’s still hard sometimes. I feel a mix of sadness and relief, I guess. Sadness because of the memories, but relief because I know it’s for the best. I’ve been feeling a bit lonely since I don’t have many close friends."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I usually listen to meditation tapes or go for walks, like I mentioned last time. Great! One technique we could try is mindfulness meditation. Have you ever practiced mindfulness before? Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment without judgment. It can help reduce anxiety. Would you like to try a brief mindfulness exercise together? Alright, let’s take a moment to focus on our breath. Inhale deeply through your nose… hold it for a moment… and exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together. Good. As you breathe, try to notice any sensations in your body. If thoughts come to mind, acknowledge them and gently bring your focus back to your breath. Maybe journaling? I’ve thought about writing down my thoughts and feelings. I’ve thought about creating a small ritual, like lighting a candle and reflecting on the good times."
Next Steps,"I could set aside a few minutes each day to just breathe and focus. That’s common. It can be helpful to set a specific time each day or week to write. Would you like to set a goal for your journaling practice? I could aim for writing once a week, maybe on Sundays. That sounds like a beautiful way to honor the past while also allowing yourself to heal. Would you like to try that for the next week? That’s a good idea. I love crafting; maybe I could join a local class. I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to take small steps toward building connections. Let’s aim to discuss your experiences with that in our next session. "
