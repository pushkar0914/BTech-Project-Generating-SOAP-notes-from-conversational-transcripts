History of Present Illness (HPI),"It went well, actually. I used the visualization techniques we talked about, and it helped a lot. It felt empowering. I was able to walk in with more confidence, and I think it showed. Yeah, I’m feeling less anxious about them now. I’m starting to enjoy the process more. I think it’s the preparation and the visualization. It makes me feel like I’m in control. It’s exciting but also a little overwhelming. There’s so much to consider. Just figuring out where to live and how to budget for everything. It’s definitely boosting my confidence. I feel more comfortable in social settings now."

Psychosocial History,"Hi, Ellie! Things have been pretty good. I’ve been focusing on my auditions and trying to stay positive. I’ve started looking at apartments online and researching neighborhoods. I have a couple of friends there. I should probably ask them for recommendations. I feel good about it. I think they’d be happy to help. I’ve been making an effort to go out more and meet new people. It’s been fun! I went to a couple of social events and even joined a local soccer league. It’s been really enjoyable. I’ve met some cool people, and it feels good to be part of a team."

Next Steps,"I want to keep practicing those techniques and maybe even try some new ones. Maybe I could try meditation or yoga. I’ve heard those can help. Sure, I think I’ll look into a yoga class. Yeah, I could create a checklist to keep track of everything. Finding a place to live is the top priority. I want to make sure I’m in a good area. I think I’m good for now. I just want to keep building on what we’ve talked about."
