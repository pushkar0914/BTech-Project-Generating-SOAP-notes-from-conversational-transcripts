History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! I’ve been doing well, thank you. Still keeping up with my meditation and spiritual practices. That’s wonderful to hear! Have you noticed any changes in how you feel or think since we last spoke? Not really, I feel pretty stable. I think the practices really help keep me grounded. I usually feel inspired and grateful. It’s like a reset button for me. I’ve realized that I often seek connections with people and cultures. I feel like that’s my way of understanding the world. I think I’m generally very open and welcoming, but sometimes I feel like I give too much of myself too quickly. I guess I just want to connect deeply. But I’m starting to realize I might need to pace myself."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Actually, yes! I went to Costa Rica recently. It was beautiful, and I loved the lush nature. The wildlife! I saw sloths and toucans. Just being in nature was so refreshing. They’re different in their own ways. Egypt was more about history and culture, while Costa Rica was about relaxation and connection with nature. I try to engage with different communities here in LA. I attend cultural events and meet people from various backgrounds."
Risk Assessment,"Sometimes, I feel like I’m not understood or that my experiences are too different from theirs. Sometimes, in group settings, I feel pressured to share more than I’m comfortable with."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve started journaling about my experiences when I travel. It helps me reflect on what I learned. I usually remind myself that everyone has their own story. I try to find common ground instead of focusing on differences. I’ve been trying to take things slower, getting to know people gradually instead of rushing in. One technique is to practice assertive communication. This involves expressing your needs clearly and respectfully. Would you like to role-play a scenario? I could say something like, “I appreciate your curiosity, but I’d prefer not to share that right now.”"
Next Steps,"Yes, I’d like to try using that approach in the next few group settings I attend."
