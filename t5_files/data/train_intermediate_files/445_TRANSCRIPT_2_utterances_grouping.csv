History of Present Illness (HPI),"Sure, it’s about feeling lost but finding light in small things.  It felt therapeutic. I was able to express some of my frustrations.  It’s been a mix of ups and downs.  Well, I had a good day at work, but I also had a frustrating argument with my girlfriend.  It was about how we manage our finances. I felt like she was criticizing me.  I tried to stay calm, but I ended up raising my voice.  I felt guilty. I don’t want to be that way around her.  I’ve been okay, but the financial stress is still there.  It feels empowering, but it’s also stressful.  Not really, I didn’t want to burden her.  I think I’m getting better at recognizing them before they escalate.  Yes, during a disagreement at work, I felt my frustration rising, but I took a moment to breathe. "

Therapeutic Interventions,Maybe taking a break before responding would help.  I’ve been budgeting more carefully and cutting back on unnecessary expenses.  Absolutely! We can work on mindfulness exercises together. 
Next Steps,"Yes, I want to keep it as a regular practice.  Not yet, but I plan to.  You’re right. I’ll try to open up to her.  I’d like to explore more about managing stress and maybe some mindfulness techniques.  Great! I’m looking forward to it. Remember to keep writing and expressing yourself. "
