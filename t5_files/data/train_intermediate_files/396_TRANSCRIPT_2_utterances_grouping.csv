History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! I’ve been okay, I did get to go hiking a couple of times.   It felt great. I really enjoyed being out in nature.   I’m glad you took that time for yourself. Did you notice any changes in your mood after those hikes?   Yeah, I felt more energized and less stressed afterward.   I did, actually. It went really well. She appreciated me opening up.   It felt like a relief. I think it helped both of us.   Just feeling a bit anxious about the future, with everything going on.   I worry about my wife and what will happen next with her mom.   I’ve been trying to stay busy, but it doesn’t always work.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I find that focusing on the breathing helps, especially when I visualize that peaceful place.   Okay, let’s take a moment to breathe in deeply… and out. Now, picture yourself in that peaceful forest again.   Let’s focus on that. As you breathe out, imagine the tension melting away.   Staying busy can be a distraction, but it’s also important to process those feelings. Would you be open to journaling about your thoughts?  "
Next Steps,"Excellent! You can use this visualization anytime you feel stressed. Would you like to set a goal to practice this technique regularly?   Yes, I’ll try to do it every night before bed.   Journaling can help you express and understand your feelings better. We can discuss how that goes in our next session.  "
