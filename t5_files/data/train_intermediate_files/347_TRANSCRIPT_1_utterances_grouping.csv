History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s understandable. Last time, we talked about your move to LA and how you’ve been feeling anxious about job hunting. Have you had any progress on that front?   A little bit, I applied to a few places but haven’t heard back yet.   It makes me anxious, I guess. I really want to find something soon.   It’s completely normal to feel that way. Have you tried any specific strategies to cope with that anxiety?   I’ve been trying to read more to distract myself, but it’s hard to focus sometimes.   That’s a good approach. Reading can be a great escape. Have you considered any mindfulness techniques or relaxation exercises?   That’s wonderful to hear! You can use this technique whenever you feel overwhelmed. Are there specific situations where you feel your anxiety spikes?   Mostly when I’m waiting to hear back from jobs or when I think about the future.   Well, I’ve always been curious about social work.   I’ve been thinking a lot about my kids and how I can be a better parent.   I want to be more present with them, especially when I’m feeling stressed.   I tend to withdraw and not engage with them as much.  "
