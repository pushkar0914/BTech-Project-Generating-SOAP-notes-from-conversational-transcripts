History of Present Illness (HPI),"Not yet. I’m a bit nervous about contacting them. I feel a bit more confident.  I think I’m a bit less anxious during the day, which is nice. I still have some ups and downs, but I feel like I’m managing it better."

Psychosocial History,"Hi! I’ve been okay. I did some research on local organizations, and I found a couple I’m interested in! There’s one that focuses on marine conservation and another that works with local aquariums for educational programs. I’ve been thinking about my relationship with my boyfriend.

Next Steps,"Awesome! Would you like to set a goal to send that email by the end of the week? Yes, I can do that! I guess I could try to be more open with him about how I’m feeling instead of just venting all the time. That’s a great idea. Communication is key in any relationship. Perhaps you could set aside time to check in with each other about how you’re both feeling? Excellent! Let’s set that as a goal for you to discuss with him.  Okay, I’ll bring it up."
