Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s a positive step! Breathing exercises can be very grounding. Would you like to practice another technique together today?   Great! Let’s try a simple body scan exercise. Find a comfortable position and close your eyes if you’re comfortable.   Now, take a deep breath in… hold it for a moment… and exhale slowly.   Good. Now, bring your awareness to your toes. Notice any sensations there…   Now, slowly move your awareness up to your feet, your legs, and continue to breathe deeply.   I’ve been trying to focus on my strengths again, like we discussed.   Maybe some positive affirmations?   That’s a wonderful idea! Let’s brainstorm a few together. How about, “I am capable and deserving of success”?   “I learn and grow from every experience.”   That’s a powerful affirmation! It emphasizes resilience. Would you like to create a list of affirmations to keep handy?  "
