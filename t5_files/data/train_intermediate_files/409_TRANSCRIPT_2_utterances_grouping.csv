History of Present Illness (HPI),"It felt good, actually. I was nervous going in, but once I did it, I felt a bit of relief. Well, I did have a couple of moments where I felt really down again, especially when I was alone at home. I think it’s just the loneliness creeping back in. Sometimes I just feel like I’m stuck in a rut. I think I’m just worried about not fitting in or being awkward again."

Physiological Observations,"I did, and it helped a bit. I still wake up sometimes, but I feel more relaxed going to bed."
Current Functional Status,"Hi, Ellie! I actually did try talking to a cashier. It was a little awkward, but I did it! I’ve thought about joining a club or something. But I still feel hesitant. I think I want someone who is understanding and shares similar interests.  I guess through hobbies or activities I enjoy. That’s why joining a club seems like a good idea."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Those feelings are very common. Remember, everyone else is there to connect as well. What if you tried attending a meeting or event just to observe first? How about trying a sleep journal? You can jot down your thoughts before bed to clear your mind. "
