Substance Use History,"I think so. I mean, I still smoke weed to relax, but I’m trying to be more mindful about it."
History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I actually went to this music festival over the weekend. It was wild!  Just the energy, man. Everyone was just vibing, dancing, and having a good time. I felt really connected to everyone. Definitely. It’s like all the worries fade away when I’m in that environment. I’ve been trying to pace myself. I don’t wanna burn out, you know? It feels good, honestly. I think I’m learning to enjoy the moments without needing to go overboard. For sure. I want to keep exploring but not at the expense of my well-being. I guess I’m just thinking about my future a lot. Like, am I doing enough with my music? I want to get more shows, maybe even record an album. But sometimes I feel like I’m not making progress. Not really. I just kinda go with the flow, but maybe I should be more proactive."

Current Functional Status,"I’ve been trying to drink more water and take breaks. Just chill for a bit instead of going all out. I think it’ll help me be more present. Sometimes I get too caught up in the moment and forget to enjoy it. Yeah, I think I can just be honest. Like, “Yo, I can’t do all that tonight, but let’s hang and chill.” I’ve looked into meditation a bit. I’m not super consistent, but I’m trying. It feels nice. I like focusing on my breath. Yeah, I feel more motivated just thinking about it."
