History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been studying a bit more too. I’m still struggling with motivation, but I’m trying to set small goals. I’ve been really interested in counseling techniques lately. I like the idea of helping people work through their issues. I’ve been reading about active listening and empathy, and I think those are really important. I think when I have deadlines for school or work. It can feel overwhelming sometimes. I’ve tried deep breathing, but I sometimes forget to do it when I’m really stressed."

Mental Health Observations,"Yeah, I feel a bit more energized, and it’s nice to have that time to myself. I think they’ve gone down a bit. I feel more in control now that I’m taking those walks and getting better sleep."
Physiological Observations,"I’ve been trying to stick to a schedule, and I think it’s helping. I feel like I’m sleeping a bit better. I’ve been aiming for around 10:30, which is earlier than I was before."
Current Functional Status,"Hi, Ellie! It’s been pretty good. I actually started taking walks like we talked about! It felt really nice! I’ve been going for short walks after work, and it helps clear my mind. I’ve been trying to study for at least 30 minutes a day instead of cramming all at once. Yes, actually! I’ve been trying to use active listening with the people I interact with, and it feels good to connect with them."

Next Steps,"Yeah, I think that would be helpful. I want to make it a habit. That’s a great idea! Let’s make that a goal for the week. How about setting a reminder on your phone to practice deep breathing daily? I can do that! I’ll try to make it part of my walk routine."
