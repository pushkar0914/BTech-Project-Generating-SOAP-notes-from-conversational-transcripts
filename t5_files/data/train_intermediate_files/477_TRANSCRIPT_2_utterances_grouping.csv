History of Present Illness (HPI),"It went surprisingly well! I found it helpful to get my thoughts down before bed. That’s fantastic! Did you notice any changes in your dreams or anxiety levels? Actually, yes. I didn’t have the dream again, which was a relief. I felt lighter, like I was able to let go of some of the stress. I wrote about my worries regarding work and how I sometimes feel inadequate. I still feel them, but writing them down made them seem less overwhelming. Not yet. I’m still a bit hesitant to open up. Okay, “I wanted to talk about how I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with my workload. I’ve been trying to manage my tasks, but I think I could use some support.” It feels a bit scary, but also empowering."
