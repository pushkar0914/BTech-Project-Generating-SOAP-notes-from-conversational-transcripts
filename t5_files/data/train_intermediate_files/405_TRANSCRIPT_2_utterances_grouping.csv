History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! It went well! I found a couple of companies and even reached out to one. Honestly, it felt empowering. I was nervous, but once I did it, I felt a bit lighter. Yes, they got back to me and invited me for an informal chat next week! I’m excited but also nervous. What if I mess up? I want them to see that I’m passionate about event planning and that I’m willing to learn. It was tough. They were upset, but I think it went better than I expected. I think being honest and letting them express their feelings made a difference. I reassured them it wasn’t their fault."
