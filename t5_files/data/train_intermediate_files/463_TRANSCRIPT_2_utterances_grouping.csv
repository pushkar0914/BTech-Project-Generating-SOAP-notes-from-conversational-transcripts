History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay. I actually updated my resume like I said I would. It felt good to finally do it. I was putting it off for a while. Yes, I found a couple of positions I’m interested in. I’m looking at nursing positions in a couple of hospitals and clinics nearby. I’ll keep that in mind. I’m a bit nervous about interviews, though. Okay, um… I’m a recent nursing graduate, and I’ve always wanted to help people. I have experience in customer service, which has helped me develop my communication skills. Right! I’m looking for a position where I can continue to learn and grow in a supportive environment. I think my strengths are being empathetic and patient. I’ve always been good at listening to others. I guess I can be a bit shy when meeting new people. That’s a good idea. I’ll say I’m trying to improve my confidence in social situations. I feel a bit more confident, actually. Practicing helps. I feel excited but also a bit anxious about the interviews."

Next Steps,"I think I’ll just send out a few applications and see what happens. That’s a solid plan! Remember to tailor your cover letter to each position. It can make a big difference. That’s honest. You could also mention how you’re working on it, like through this therapy. It’s understandable to feel that way. Perhaps you could set boundaries by letting them know when you have updates instead of feeling pressured to share constantly. That sounds like a good idea. I’ll talk to them about it. You’re doing great! Let’s wrap up for today. Keep practicing those techniques and stay positive about your job search."
