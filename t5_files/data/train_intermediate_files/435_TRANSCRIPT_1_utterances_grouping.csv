Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve started journaling. It helps me to put my thoughts down and see them clearly.   I try to take deep breaths and remind myself to stay present, but it doesn’t always work.   How about we try some mindfulness exercises together? It can help ground you in the present moment.   It felt nice. I think I need to do that more often.   I guess it would mean taking small steps and being okay with making mistakes.   I feel like I have some tools to work with.  "
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that. We can incorporate this into your daily routine. How do you feel about setting a goal to practice mindfulness for a few minutes each day?   That’s a healthy mindset. Would you be willing to set a small goal for yourself this week?   How about setting a goal to try something new, even if it’s just a small task?  "
