Next Steps,I could definitely make more time for it. Maybe I could go out every weekend or even after work sometimes. Maybe I could do some freelance work or sell prints online. I’ve thought about that. I could set up a website and start promoting my work on social media. I’ve been wanting to do that for a while. I guess I should just start and not worry too much about perfection. That's a great mindset to adopt. Perfectionism can often hold us back. How about we set a goal for you to take some actionable steps towards this website by our next session? That sounds good! Maybe I could aim to have a rough draft of the website ready.
