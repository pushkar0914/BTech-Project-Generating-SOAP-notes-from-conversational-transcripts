History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. Last time, we talked about some of your feelings and experiences. Have you noticed anything different in your mood or thoughts since then?   Not really, I think I’m still feeling the same.   That’s alright. Sometimes it takes time for things to change. Have you had any moments where you felt particularly down or happy?   I think I felt a bit down last week. Just a lot on my mind, I guess.   I see. Would you like to share what was on your mind?   Just the usual worries about work and my kids.   Those are significant concerns. Can you tell me more about your worries regarding work?   Well, I’m still looking for a job, and it’s frustrating. I feel like I’m not making any progress.   That’s understandable. Job searching can be really challenging. Have you been able to apply for any positions?   A few, but I haven’t heard back from anyone.   That can feel discouraging. How do you cope with that frustration?   I try to distract myself with music or hanging out with friends, but it doesn’t always help.   Fantastic! Let’s also talk about your kids. You mentioned feeling a bit overwhelmed with parenting. How have you been feeling about that recently?   It’s tough. Sometimes I feel like I’m not doing enough for them.   Maybe spend more time with them or do something fun together.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Perhaps we could look into some mindfulness techniques or journaling to help process your feelings. Would you be open to that?   Yeah, I guess I could try that.   Great! Journaling can be a helpful way to express your thoughts and feelings. Would you be willing to write about your experiences with job searching this week?   Sure, I can do that.   Wonderful! And how about mindfulness? Have you ever tried any breathing exercises?   It’s quite simple. We can practice a short one together now if you’d like.   Okay, let’s do it.   Alright, let’s take a deep breath in through your nose… and out through your mouth.   Good. Let’s do that a couple more times. In… and out.   I’m glad to hear that. Breathing exercises can be a quick way to reduce stress. Would you be open to incorporating that into your daily routine?   Yeah, I think I could do that.  "
Next Steps,"Those sound like fun options. Would you like to set a goal to plan something with them this week?   Yeah, I can try to do that.   Alright, let’s recap what we’ve discussed. You’ll try journaling about your job search, practice mindfulness exercises, and plan a fun activity with your kids. Does that sound good?  "
