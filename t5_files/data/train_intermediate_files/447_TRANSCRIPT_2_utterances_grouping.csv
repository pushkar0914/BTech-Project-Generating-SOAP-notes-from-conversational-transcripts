History of Present Illness (HPI),"Mostly about my feelings and some of the things that happened during the week. It’s nice to let it all out. Yeah, I’ve realized that I tend to get angry when I feel overwhelmed or like I’m not in control. It makes sense. I guess I just need to find ways to cope better when I start feeling that way. I’ve been working out more, and journaling definitely helps. But I still struggle sometimes. I’ve heard of mindfulness but never really tried it. I did! I wrote one about feeling lost and trying to find my way again.  Just some feelings I’ve been having. It felt good to express it in a song. I’ve thought about it but not sure if I’m ready for that. Yeah, actually. I got into a disagreement with a friend about something trivial, and I felt myself getting really worked up. I took a step back and tried to breathe, which helped a bit. But I still ended up snapping at them. Maybe I could try to communicate my feelings better instead of just reacting. “I feel frustrated when you dismiss my opinion. I need us to find a solution together.”"

Therapeutic Interventions,"Mindfulness can be a powerful tool for grounding yourself in the present moment. Would you like to explore some techniques together? Great! One simple technique is focusing on your breath. Let’s try it together for a moment.  Close your eyes if you feel comfortable. Take a deep breath in through your nose… and out through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times. As you breathe, notice any sensations in your body. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath.  That’s wonderful! Practicing mindfulness regularly can help you manage stress and anger more effectively. Would you like to incorporate this into your routine? That’s a great insight. Practicing assertive communication can help you express your feelings without escalating the situation. Would you like to role-play a scenario to practice? Let’s say you’re in a disagreement with your friend. You can start by expressing how you feel and what you need.  That’s the power of assertive communication! Practicing this can lead to healthier interactions. "
Next Steps,"That’s completely understandable. Sharing your art can be vulnerable, but it can also be rewarding. Perhaps you could start by sharing it with your close friends? I want to keep journaling, practice mindfulness, and maybe try that communication technique with my friends."
