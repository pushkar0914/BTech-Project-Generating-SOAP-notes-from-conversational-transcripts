Mental Health Observations,controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that i could've handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped you know i told my mother uh like um i don't like this uh you need you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me <m>  me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally um my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there i felt conflicting feelings on one hand my brother was protecting me from getting beat and on the other hand he was hitting my mom my behavior i'm more mellow um i laugh more more humorous i let a lot of things go that i used to just let tick me off and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and mm you <y> you just can't control that i think i matured mentally and psychologically eh acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall i'm back then i just tolerated myself now i um actually like myself and um it will behoove <beh> behoove you to feel the same way because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always reveal it they can't hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i i know human behavior when i see it and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people um have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them
Physiological Observations,i'm doing very good today uh most nights i don't i go to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably <prob> i'm more than likely up at seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep it it depends it depends on the environment i'm in um if i don't sleep well i'm going eventually i'm gonna be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if there are difficult people that's gonna be a challenge for me and um if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didn't get much sleep
Current Functional Status,i'm not working right now i actually moved away and i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job um in order to make that move but since i came back down i've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so i can get back into counseling it can be it can be very difficult at times because so right now i'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um
