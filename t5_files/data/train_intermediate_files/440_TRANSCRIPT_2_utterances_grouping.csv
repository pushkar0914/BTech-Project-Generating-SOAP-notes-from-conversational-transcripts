History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been really helpful. I feel like I can get my thoughts out without judgment. Yes, I tend to write a lot about my feelings of guilt and stress. I think I need to remind myself that it’s okay to take time for myself. It makes me feel accomplished and creative. We talked about our feelings and realized we both feel overwhelmed. It feels good to know we’re on the same page, but it’s also a bit daunting. I feel a bit nervous, but I think it’s worth it. I’ve been thinking about how to support my son better while he’s going through this. I want to be there for him emotionally but also set boundaries for myself. I think I need to limit how much I let his situation affect my mood. I feel more empowered to take charge of my feelings and my family dynamics."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Maybe something like, “I deserve to take care of myself” or “My happiness matters.” Yes, I think that could be really beneficial."
Next Steps,I could set aside specific times to work on it without distractions. Maybe we can set aside time each week to check in with each other. I think we’d take turns sharing how we feel and what we need from each other. I could write down what I want to say beforehand. Maybe I could write them down and keep them visible. That’s wonderful to hear! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Let’s continue to explore these themes in our next session.
