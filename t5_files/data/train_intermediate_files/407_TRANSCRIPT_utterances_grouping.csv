History of Present Illness (HPI),i'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month an a week
Medical and Psychiatric History,well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um studying <stu> i was took i took communications and uh did general ed stuff too and um took like video production classes and um <tisk> did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and become an optician so but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans and i still actually i got into um playing poker a few years ago and i really like the idea of becoming a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of and you have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere to be an optician uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but it just like specifically trains you into um one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and all these other classes like you normally would do for like um like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si> it sound like something maybe i could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually um got my attention to be an optician so i'm now trying to be an optician and it's interesting so it's fun it's um really hard but it's interesting and it and it's it's fun it has um rewarding rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel more comfortable with i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and i was um working for production assistant for filmmakers around um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment and then i got involved with like uh the wrong group of people i guess and kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with those kind of people that kinda of girl probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that i don't think it would end up working out anyways so to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her uh my ex girlfriend i wish i'd never met her my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them 'cause uh we <w> we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard <tisk> uh no no <tisk> i wish i was um <xxx> i wish i was like fifteen pounds lighter i wish i didn't need i need to be like in a relationship with a girl i feel like i wish i didn't have to be that i needed to have a girl all the time and i wish that like i didn't need sexual um i wasn't always thinking about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as i do 'cause i feel like if i didn't concentrate or have to do like get be with girls or in a relationship to like well who i don't know how to say it but i'm just saying like i there's like guy friends that i know that don't need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didn't need <n> need it as much so maybe i guess i'm addicted to it a little bit where like i i could focus on more things other than just i mean i don't just focus on sex but i just feel like if focus on if i didn't want it need it or think i need it as much that i could get more stuff done in my life i'm most proud <prou> oh i guess i guess i'm most proud of working for um television station back in sacramento and working on a lot of um film sets 'cause like i i was sixteen and i decided i wanted to be a fimmaker and then two years later a year and a half later basically i got i started making steps to become a filmmaker and then i ended up working <wor> working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really good um cinematographer a really good um freelance cinematographer that was based that lives in sacramento they did a lot of things so i'm proud that had a dream and i went for it and i and actually ended up doing stuff to go towards my dream that were in my dream so um yeah i guess that's one of my biggest accomplishments which was like
Psychosocial History,uh i moved to l_a when i was an infant and then i left here when i was around three or four and i've been move i moved back here in oh seven and i've been living here um ever since um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um

Current Functional Status,all day yesterday almost and i usually i'm doing something if it's not work it's school if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so um i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school i only have school on the weekdays wow since i've been here since oh seven i've only been back maybe <clears thoat> a couple times <ti> well i went there for like a summer eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of california like six times so i would like to travel playing poker is um actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like um stuff in the past or present um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela> i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter> that i'll be okay and that everything will be okay but you know it's hard um deal with them i i don't really i just keep going you know go to school and work and i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of and like sleeping uh playing poker playing basketball deals helps me deal with it and like uh hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes i went to san diego for the first time
