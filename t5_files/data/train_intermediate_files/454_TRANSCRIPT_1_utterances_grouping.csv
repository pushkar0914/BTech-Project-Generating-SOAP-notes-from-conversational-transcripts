History of Present Illness (HPI),"Just how I can be more patient and understanding, especially with my twins. They can be a handful at times. Yes, during bedtime routines. It can get chaotic, and I find myself getting frustrated. Not really. I tend to avoid those conversations because I don’t want to escalate things. I feel a bit nervous but also relieved to express how I feel."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I’ve been thinking about my relationship with my kids a lot. I want to be the best parent I can be. I think they might find it fun. They love playing games, so I could frame it that way. Sometimes with my sister. We have our disagreements, and I find myself getting annoyed. She can be very opinionated, and I sometimes feel like she doesn’t listen to me. I’ve been thinking about my career aspirations too. I still feel drawn to working with underserved children, but I’m not sure how to start."
Risk Assessment,I guess I could try. I just worry about how she’ll react.
Mental Health Observations,Nothing reported
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,"I try to stick to a routine, but sometimes it just doesn't go as planned. Not really. I usually just dive straight into the routine."

Therapeutic Interventions,"How about we discuss a simple breathing exercise you could do together? It might help set a calmer tone. Perfect! You could take a few deep breaths together, inhaling for a count of four, holding for four, and exhaling for four. Want to give it a try now? Excellent! One technique is to use ""I"" statements, which can help express your feelings without sounding accusatory. For example, saying ""I feel overwhelmed when…"" instead of ""You always…"".  Sure! Let’s see… I could say, “I feel unheard when you interrupt me during our conversations.”"
Next Steps,"I could volunteer or look for local organizations that need help. That’s a fantastic idea! Volunteering can provide valuable experience and connections. Would you like to set a goal to research some opportunities before our next session? Yes, I can do that. I’ll look into it."
