History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey! It’s been alright. I tried to play with my dog more, and I think it helped a bit. It was nice. Just being outside and playing fetch made me feel a little better. I did! I started making sandwiches or having some fruit. It’s been easier than I thought. I still have moments where I feel really down, especially when I think about the job situation. I try to distract myself, but sometimes it feels like it just lingers."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One technique is called “grounding.” It involves focusing on the present moment and can help reduce feelings of anxiety or sadness. Would you like to try a quick exercise now? Good! That’s a great observation. Now, let’s take another deep breath in... and out. Remember that you can return to this exercise whenever you feel overwhelmed."
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about finding what works for you. How about we set a goal to practice this grounding technique a few times this week? Yeah, I can do that."
