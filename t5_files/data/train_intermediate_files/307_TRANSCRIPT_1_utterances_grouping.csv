History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I felt lighter, you know? Like I could breathe again. But now that I’m back, reality is hitting me hard.   Just the job search and feeling stuck again. It’s like, I was so free there, and now I’m back to stressing about money and work.   I’ve been trying to keep up with my workouts and photography, but it’s hard when I feel overwhelmed.   I think I need to make it a priority. It just gets hard to motivate myself when I feel down.   Honestly, it’s been frustrating. I apply to jobs but don’t hear back, and it just makes me feel like I’m not good enough.   Yeah, definitely something more creative and engaging. I want to feel like I’m making a difference, not just sitting at a desk.   I have, but it feels so daunting. Like, I don’t know where to start.   Yeah, we’ve been trying. It’s just hard sometimes when we get caught up in our own frustrations.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Great! How about setting a goal to take a photo every day or go for a short walk?   That sounds doable! I could definitely manage that.   Maybe start by creating a portfolio of your best work or reaching out to local photographers for advice?   That’s completely normal. It might help to schedule regular check-ins, just to talk about how you’re both feeling.  "
Next Steps,"Of course! So, let’s summarize today’s session. You’ll aim to take a photo every day, reach out to your roommates, and consider taking more steps towards photography. Does that sound good?  "
