History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I still feel anxious about not having a job. It weighs on me a lot. A few, but I keep second-guessing myself. I feel like I’m not qualified enough. I try to meditate, but sometimes it just feels overwhelming. I thought, “I’ll never find a job,” after I didn’t hear back from a couple of applications."

Progress Evaluation,Nothing reported
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"How about we aim to put your phone away an hour before bed? Instead, you could read or listen to calming music. Great! And maybe incorporate some light stretching or meditation before sleep? "
Next Steps,"That’s wonderful to hear. Let’s keep practicing this technique. How about we set a goal for you to apply to a certain number of jobs this week? That sounds good. Maybe three applications? Perfect. So, your routine could look like this: put away your phone by 10 PM, do some light stretching, and then meditate for a few minutes before bed. That’s a valid goal. We can continue to work on strategies to manage your anxiety. Would you be interested in exploring mindfulness techniques next time?"
