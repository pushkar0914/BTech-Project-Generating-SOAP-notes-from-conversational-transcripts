History of Present Illness (HPI),"They’ve been a bit of a rollercoaster, to be honest. Well, I tried the open-ended questions with my son, and it worked a little. He opened up about some school stress, but he still shuts down at times. I felt relieved that he talked to me, but also worried about how much pressure he’s under. We talked about taking breaks and finding time for fun, but I think he still feels overwhelmed. I’ve been going to the beach more often, and it’s been great. I even started journaling about my feelings. It’s been really cathartic. I didn’t realize how much I had bottled up. Mostly just worries about the future and my kids. I also write about my dreams and goals. I want to explore more about pursuing a career in counseling. I think it could be a good fit for me."
