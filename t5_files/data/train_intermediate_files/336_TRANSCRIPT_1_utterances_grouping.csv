History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I’m trying to juggle my singing gigs and my regular job, and it feels like there’s just not enough time in the day. Not really. I feel like I’m constantly rushing and not doing either one well. I’ve tried making schedules, but they never seem to stick. I get distracted easily. Mostly social media and just... I don’t know, my mind wandering to other things. I think it’s just my habit of procrastination. I tend to put things off until the last minute. I end up binge-watching shows or scrolling through my phone instead of focusing on what I need to do. Honestly? I feel guilty and stressed because I know I should be doing something else. It’s been a bit better, actually. My girlfriend has been helping me unwind at night. She usually suggests we watch something light or do a meditation together. Yes, I think it does. It’s nice to have that time together, too. I had a small gig last week, and I felt really good about my performance. It felt amazing, like I was in my element. I love connecting with the audience."

Therapeutic Interventions,"It might help to set boundaries for yourself. For example, you could allocate certain times for social media and stick to those. I guess I could try. Maybe I could set a timer for short bursts of work and then reward myself with a break. That sounds perfect! You could use the Pomodoro technique. After 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break. How does that sound? It might be helpful to set a specific time for it, maybe even right before bed. Would you be open to trying that? I try to remind myself of the good things I’ve accomplished, like my singing. It might be helpful to reframe that fear. Instead of focusing on rejection, what if you viewed it as a chance to grow and learn?"
Next Steps,"I could look for more gigs or open mic nights. I’ve been hesitant, but I think I need to push myself. Great! Remember, every performance is an opportunity to improve. How about we set a goal for you to find one new gig before our next session? I can do that! I’ll look into it."
