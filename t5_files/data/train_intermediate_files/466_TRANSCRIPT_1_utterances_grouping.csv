History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s understandable. Last time, you mentioned feeling immobilized by your agoraphobia. Have you had any experiences with that since we last spoke? Yes, I tried going for a short walk outside. It was challenging, but I managed to do it. It was kind of freeing but also terrifying. I felt really anxious at first. They helped somewhat, but I still felt a lot of panic. It’s like my mind is always racing. I can see how that would be difficult. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that trigger your panic during these moments? Yes, I often think about what could go wrong, like getting lost or having a panic attack in public. I often think, “What if I have a panic attack?” I’ve had panic attacks before, and they were really scary."

Current Functional Status,"I’ve been reading a lot more, which helps distract me. I’ve been diving into some self-help books and some fiction. It helps me escape reality a bit. Yes, actually. I read about characters overcoming fears, and it inspires me to think I can do the same."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I practiced some deep breathing exercises before I left. I also reminded myself that I could turn back if it got too overwhelming. Those thoughts can be quite distressing. Would you be open to trying some cognitive restructuring techniques to challenge those thoughts? Maybe I could think, “If I get lost, I can ask for help.”  I could say, “Even if I have a panic attack, I can manage it.” "
Next Steps,"That’s a powerful connection! It’s important to remind ourselves that we can overcome our challenges. Have you thought about setting small, achievable goals for yourself based on what you’ve read? Yes, I’d like to set a goal to go for a walk every week. I think I’ll start with just a few minutes at a time and gradually increase it. Maybe I could treat myself to a nice coffee or a new book."
