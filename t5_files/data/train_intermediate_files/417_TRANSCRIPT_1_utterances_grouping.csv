History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, I’ve been okay. A bit anxious, but overall, I’m managing. Yeah, I think so. I’ve had some good days, but there are still moments where I feel overwhelmed. Well, sometimes it’s just little things, like being in a crowded place or having too much on my to-do list. It can just hit me suddenly. I’ve been trying to practice deep breathing. It helps a little, but it’s hard to remember to do it in the moment."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I’ve been looking into programs and classes, but I’m still unsure about committing. I think I need to remind myself that it’s a process and that I can learn along the way. We’ve been okay. We still have our moments, but I think we’re getting better at communicating. We’ve been trying to talk things out more calmly instead of arguing right away. Yeah, I think we’re both more willing to listen to each other now. Maybe being more open about how we’re feeling instead of waiting for things to escalate. I hope so. I really want us to be able to talk about anything."

Next Steps,"Yeah, I could try that. Maybe in the morning or before bed? Maybe I could start by attending a few workshops or volunteering somewhere. Yeah, I could aim to find something in the next month. I could start by sharing my feelings first and encouraging him to do the same. I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you’re doing great work. Let’s plan to touch base on your goals and mindfulness practice next time."
