History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing well. I’ve been focusing on staying positive and connecting with my co-workers.   Yes! I went out for coffee with a couple of them last week, and it was really nice.   It felt good! It was nice to talk about things other than work and just get to know them better.   Definitely! I feel more energized and less lonely. It’s nice to have that support.   It really shifts my focus. Even on tough days, I can find something positive to hold onto.   Sometimes, it’s hard to think of things when I’m feeling down. I can get stuck in negative thoughts.   That makes sense. I often blow things out of proportion when I’m feeling low.   I remember thinking I’m not good enough for this job when I made a mistake last week.   Well, I’ve been doing well overall, and my supervisor said I’m improving.   I guess I could say that everyone makes mistakes, and I’m learning and improving.   It feels good! I can see that I’m not defined by my mistakes.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to focus on gratitude. I write down a few things I’m thankful for each day.   One technique could be to challenge negative thoughts. When you notice them, ask yourself if they’re really true.   I’ve been going for walks more often. It helps clear my head.   That’s a powerful realization. Keep practicing that reframing technique when negative thoughts arise.  "
