Current Functional Status,"I’ve been okay. I actually went to that art class we talked about!   It was really nice. I met a couple of people, and we talked a bit.   I loved just being in a creative space again, and the instructor was super nice.   Yeah, there was one person who seemed really friendly. We talked about our favorite artists.   I haven’t yet. I’m not sure how to go about it.   I found a few volunteer opportunities with local conservation groups.  "
