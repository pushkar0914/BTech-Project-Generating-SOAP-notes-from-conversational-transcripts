History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, we’re still planning on moving to Ecuador in the fall. We’ve been doing a lot of preparations, and it’s exciting but also a bit overwhelming. I think just the logistics of moving and making sure everything is in order for our kids. It’s a lot to think about. I’ve been thinking about my brother a lot. I feel guilty sometimes for not being closer to him. I guess because I know he struggles, and I want to be there for him, but it’s hard with the way he is. It makes me feel hopeful. I want to build that relationship, even if it’s just little by little."

Progress Evaluation,"I’ve been more aware of it. I try to take a moment before reacting, especially with my wife. It’s been helpful. Just last week, my wife and I had a disagreement about our kids' bedtime. Instead of getting frustrated, I took a moment to breathe and then talked it through calmly. It went really well. We ended up finding a solution that worked for both of us. I felt proud of how I handled it."
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"Mindfulness can be as simple as taking a few minutes to focus on your breath or being present in the moment. Would you like to try a short mindfulness exercise together now? Great! Let’s take a deep breath in… and out. Focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath. How does that feel?"
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that. Practicing mindfulness regularly can help reduce anxiety. Do you think you could incorporate this into your daily routine? I think I could try it, especially when I’m feeling overwhelmed. I’ve thought about visiting him more often, maybe just spending time doing simple activities together. Maybe just watching a movie or playing a game. Something low-pressure. I’m glad to hear that. Let’s set a goal for you to practice mindfulness this week and maybe plan a visit with your brother. How does that sound?"
