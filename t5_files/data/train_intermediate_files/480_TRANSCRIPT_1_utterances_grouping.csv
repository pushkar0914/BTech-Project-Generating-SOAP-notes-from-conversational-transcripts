Subsection,Grouped_Utterances
Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,I guess I’m just feeling a bit stuck creatively. I want to do more with my comedy but don’t know where to start. I’d like to write more material and maybe perform at an open mic night.
Trauma History,Nothing reported
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been alright, a bit busy with work. You know how it is. Yeah, a couple of times. I had a deadline, and I felt the pressure building up.  I think I need to do that. I often let work take over my evenings. I think I worry they might not have time to talk or that I’ll burden them with my problems."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I had dinner with my best friend last week. We talked about everything, and it felt good to connect. Yes, I do. He’s really good at listening. A couple, but not as much as him. I guess I should try to connect with them more often."
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,"It felt refreshing. I didn’t realize how much I needed it until I was there. I felt a bit more at ease, but then I started thinking about all the work I had waiting for me. It lifted my spirits. I always feel better after talking to him."
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,Nothing reported
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,Nothing reported
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"Absolutely, the freelance life can be quite hectic. Have you been able to implement any of the coping strategies we discussed last time, like yoga or taking peaceful walks? Yeah, I actually went for a walk in the park last weekend. It was nice to get some fresh air. I tried to remind myself that I could tackle my work after the walk. It helped a bit. I just pushed through it. I stayed up late to finish, which I know isn’t the best way. That’s a great realization. Perhaps we can explore some ways to create a more structured schedule for you. Would you be open to that?"
Next Steps,I can try that. It might be good for me. Those sound like excellent goals! How about we set a small goal for you to write a certain amount of material this week?  That sounds doable. Maybe I can aim for a few minutes of new content. Perfect! Let’s aim for five minutes of new material. How does that sound? I like that. It’s not overwhelming.
