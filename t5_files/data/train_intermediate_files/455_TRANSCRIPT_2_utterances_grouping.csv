History of Present Illness (HPI),"Sure! There was a moment when someone asked about my family, and I felt it was too personal. So, I used the response we practiced. It felt liberating! The person respected my response, and I didn’t feel pressured to share more. Yes, it made me feel more confident. I realized I can still connect without overexposing myself. I feel less anxious in social situations. It’s like I have more control over my narrative. There was one situation where I felt tempted to overshare again, but I caught myself. I’ve been writing about my feelings of connection and disconnection. It’s interesting to see how I navigate those emotions. It’s cathartic. I can see my growth and understand my emotions better. I think I still struggle with feelings of loneliness at times, especially when I’m not around friends. I think it’s the contrast of being around so many people and then feeling isolated when I’m alone."
