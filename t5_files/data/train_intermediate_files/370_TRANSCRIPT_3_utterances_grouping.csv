Next Steps,"I think I need to keep reminding myself that it’s my day, and I should enjoy it. I also want to take moments to step back and breathe. I want to take a few moments alone with my partner to soak it all in. I think that will help. We have! We talked about staying united and focusing on each other, no matter what happens with family. I think I need to set clear boundaries for my time. I don’t want to let one overshadow the other. I could create a weekly schedule where I allocate time for PhD work and wedding-related tasks, so I’m not overwhelmed. Sure! I think I’d like to dedicate certain days to focus on my PhD readings and assignments, and then have specific days for wedding tasks."
