History of Present Illness (HPI),i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like
Medical and Psychiatric History,no no
Psychosocial History,i grew up in oklahoma um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much i studied philosophy and um political theory and government and did a little bit of english literature on the side i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that you know i have actually studied to become a success coach aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers <laughter> pretty good i think um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no it would've probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would've been a friendly argument probably with one of my liberal friends so i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back that makes me feel bad sometimes well i have a brother i'm very close to him he's married um i have a nephew um my both of my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them on my father's side there's one brother um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences um we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging i think i wish that i was in a relationship and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore
