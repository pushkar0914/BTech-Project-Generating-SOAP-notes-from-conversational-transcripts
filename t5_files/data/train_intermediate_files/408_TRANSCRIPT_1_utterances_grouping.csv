History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yes, actually. I’ve been thinking about how much I miss traveling, especially after hearing about my friend’s trip to Japan. It made me want to plan something soon. It makes me feel happy and a bit anxious at the same time. I want to make sure everything goes smoothly. It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions about travel. What do you think contributes to your anxiety about it? I think it’s the logistics. Planning flights, accommodations, and making sure I don’t miss anything important. It’s mainly deadlines and the pressure to perform well. I want to succeed, but sometimes it feels like too much."
