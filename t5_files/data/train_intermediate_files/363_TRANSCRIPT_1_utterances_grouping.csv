History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time, you mentioned that you were feeling more easygoing since your heart attack. Has that continued? Yes, it has. I find myself not sweating the small stuff as much anymore. It's refreshing. That’s a great mindset to have. Have there been any situations recently where you felt that way? Well, there was a minor issue with a client who was unhappy with some of my work. Instead of getting stressed, I just took a deep breath and resolved it calmly. It felt empowering. I realized that I can control my reactions now, which is something I struggled with before."

Next Steps,"I’m planning to start walking more often and maybe join a local gym. I just need to get motivated. That’s a great motivator! Maybe you could set small, achievable goals to help with that? Yes, that makes sense. I could start with a goal of walking a certain number of days each week. I think three days a week is doable."
