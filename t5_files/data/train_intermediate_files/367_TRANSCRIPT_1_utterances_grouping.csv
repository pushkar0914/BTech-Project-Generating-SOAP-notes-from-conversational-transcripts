History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I actually have. I managed to write a few more chapters of my novel. It's been a bit therapeutic. It feels good, but sometimes it gets heavy. I find myself reflecting on my own past while writing. I try to channel them into my writing, but sometimes it just makes me feel more down. Yeah, that could work. I just worry about how they’ll react. I’ve been trying to tailor my resume more, but it feels like a shot in the dark sometimes. I haven’t really thought about that. I guess I’m just nervous about it."
