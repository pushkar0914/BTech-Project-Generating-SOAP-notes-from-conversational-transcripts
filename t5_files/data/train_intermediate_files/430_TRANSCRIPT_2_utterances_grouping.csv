History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie! I’ve been okay. I’ve been thinking a lot about our last discussion on my family. I realized that I often feel disconnected from my parents. We don’t talk much, and I miss that closeness. I think it’s partly my fault. I’ve been so focused on my own life and struggles that I haven’t made an effort to reach out. I’ve considered calling them more often, but I worry about what to say. It feels awkward. That might work! I think I’d like to hear about their experiences. It could help me understand them better. I think they’d appreciate the effort. They’ve always been supportive, even if we don’t communicate much. I guess I feel guilty sometimes for not being more present in their lives. I want to change that. I’ve also been feeling a bit anxious about my job lately. I’m not sure if I’m in the right place. I feel like I’m not challenged enough, and I worry about stagnating. I want to grow, but I’m not sure how."

Next Steps,"I think just making an effort to reach out regularly would help. Maybe even visiting them more often. I feel hopeful. I think it’ll make me feel more connected. I haven’t yet, but that’s a good idea. I think I need to be more proactive about my career. I guess I could prepare some ideas for projects I’d like to take on. That way, I have something concrete to discuss. It makes me feel empowered. I like the idea of taking control of my career."
