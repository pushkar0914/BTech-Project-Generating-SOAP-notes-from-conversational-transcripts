Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,I guess I’m just curious about how to manage my feelings of anxiety when I’m working on something big.
Trauma History,Nothing reported
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, actually, I landed a couple of new gigs. It's been exciting! It's really fulfilling. I feel like I'm finally getting recognized for my skills. I love the creativity involved and meeting new people. Each project has its own vibe. A bit, yeah. I still feel shy, but I push through it. I think the excitement of the work helps. It pushes me to think outside the box and try new techniques. I want to keep evolving. A bit nervous, but mostly excited. I think it’ll help me process my feelings about the transition. That’s a relevant concern. Have you experienced anxiety in the past when working on significant projects? Yes, especially when deadlines approach. I tend to overthink things."

Current Functional Status,"I think so, especially when meeting new friends. It helps me open up more. Yes! I went to a gallery opening last weekend, and it was really inspiring. Just seeing the different styles and meeting artists who share the same passion was energizing."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Sometimes I remind myself that everyone is there to enjoy the same thing, so it’s easier to connect. I try to focus on the positives. I tell myself that I'm building a future for myself. Great! We can work on techniques like mindfulness or time management strategies. Would you like to try a quick mindfulness exercise now? It’s calming. I like it."
Next Steps,I want to start a personal project that reflects my experiences since moving to LA. Maybe the contrast between my past in New York and my new life here. It could be interesting. I’m thinking of documenting everyday moments and conversations with people I meet. I’d like to start in the next month. I need to gather some ideas first. Wonderful! Practicing this regularly can help you ground yourself during anxious moments. Would you like to set a goal for incorporating mindfulness into your routine? I can try to do it a few times a week.
