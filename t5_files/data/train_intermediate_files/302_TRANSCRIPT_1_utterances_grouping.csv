History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time, we talked about your feelings surrounding your mother's passing and how it affects you. Have you noticed any changes in those feelings since then?   I think about her a lot, but I’ve been trying to focus on the good memories, like we discussed.   That sounds like a positive approach. Have you had any specific memories that brought you joy recently?   Yeah, actually. I was looking through some old photos, and there was one of us at the beach. It made me smile.   That’s wonderful! It’s great that you can find joy in those memories. How did you feel afterward?   A bit nostalgic, but in a good way. It didn’t make me sad.   That's a significant step. Do you feel like you’re coping better with your grief?   I think so. It’s still hard, but I’m trying to accept that it’s part of life.   Absolutely. Grief can be a long process. You mentioned feeling down sometimes. Have there been any triggers for those feelings lately?   Not really. I mean, there are moments, but they’re not as intense as before.   That sounds lovely! How did that experience feel for you?   It was refreshing. Being outdoors helped clear my mind.   Great! How do you feel about your job situation? Any updates since we last spoke?   I’ve been applying to a few positions, but nothing yet. It’s a bit frustrating.   I can understand that. Job searching can be a challenging process. How do you cope with that frustration?   I try not to dwell on it. I remind myself that it takes time.   Networking is a fantastic strategy! Have you had any positive responses from those outreach efforts?   A couple of people offered to help me look for openings.   Support is crucial during challenging times. Have you had any moments of self-doubt during this process?   Sometimes, I wonder if I’m good enough for the jobs I’m applying for.   It’s common to feel that way, especially in competitive job markets. How do you usually counter those thoughts?   I try to remind myself of my skills and experiences.   That’s a fantastic example! It shows your creativity and patience. How does reflecting on these strengths make you feel?   It boosts my confidence a bit.  "

Next Steps,"Nature can be very therapeutic. Have you considered incorporating more outdoor activities into your routine?   I think I will. It’s nice to disconnect and just enjoy the moment.   That’s a healthy mindset. Have you thought about any specific strategies to help with your job search?   I’ve been networking more, reaching out to old colleagues.   That’s a solid strategy. Would it be helpful to create a list of your strengths and achievements together?   Yeah, that could be useful.   Let’s do that. What are some strengths you believe you possess?   I’m patient, creative, and good at problem-solving.   Those are excellent qualities, especially for working with children. Can you think of specific examples where you demonstrated these strengths?   Well, when I was volunteering, I helped kids with their homework, and I had to come up with different ways to explain things.   That’s great to hear! Building confidence is essential, especially as you navigate your job search. What other goals would you like to focus on in our future sessions?   I think I’d like to work on managing my anxiety about the job search and maybe explore more coping strategies.   Absolutely! We can definitely explore that. Would it be helpful to practice some mindfulness techniques in our next session?   Yes, I think that would be beneficial.  "
