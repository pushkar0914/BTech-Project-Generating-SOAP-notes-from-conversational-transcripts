History of Present Illness (HPI),uh just unemployed at the moment but uh actively seeking uh uh doing what i'm supposed to be doing uh there are some uh  some prospects there but hopefully i'll learn something today troubling times but uh we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel the troubling times i had uh gotten a d_u_i last year and uh lost my job i'm a truck driver by trade so  threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh i'm choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work it's hard to find work with uh without going to school  but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully i'll get that job i should have that job actually so but i'm starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis   uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh  what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest  don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts  or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over uh lately i have been probably about the last few months say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh  i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and  you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities 
Medical and Psychiatric History,uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and  and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um  a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago  uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um
