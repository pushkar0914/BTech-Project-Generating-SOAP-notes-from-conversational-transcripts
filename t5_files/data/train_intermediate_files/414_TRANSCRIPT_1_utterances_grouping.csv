History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. Last time we talked about some tough experiences, especially regarding your mental health. Have there been any significant changes or challenges since then? That sounds frustrating. Have you been able to try any strategies to help with your sleep? I’ve been trying to limit screen time before bed, but sometimes I get caught up in watching shows. It’s like I can’t help myself. That’s a common struggle. It can be tough to break that habit. Have you noticed if certain shows affect your sleep differently than others? It’s all about creating a routine. Speaking of routines, how have you been managing your emotions since we last spoke? I’ve been trying to be more aware of when I’m getting upset. I think I’m getting better at it, but it’s still a work in progress. That’s a positive step. Have there been any specific situations where you felt you managed your emotions well? Actually, yeah! I had a disagreement with a classmate about a project, and instead of blowing up, I just took a deep breath and talked it out. That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’re developing better communication skills. How did that make you feel afterward? I felt relieved. It’s nice to know I can handle things without getting too emotional. That’s a significant achievement. It’s important to celebrate those small victories. Have you been able to talk to Ryan since our last session? I have! We talked things over, and it felt good. We’re still not back to where we were, but it’s a start. That’s great to hear. What do you think helped facilitate that conversation? I think just being honest about how much I missed him and how I wanted to work things out.  That sounds like a solid plan. Regular communication can definitely help strengthen your friendship. On another note, how has your therapy been going with your new therapist? That’s understandable. Sometimes it takes time to adjust to a new therapist. Have you shared your feelings about that with her? Not yet. I’m not sure how to bring it up without sounding rude. I’ve been brainstorming some ideas for short films, but I haven’t started anything yet. Just been a bit stuck, I guess. It’s normal to feel stuck sometimes. What do you think is holding you back from starting? I think it’s fear of not being good enough or not getting it right.  I think that covers it. I feel a bit lighter just talking about everything."
Medical and Psychiatric History,It’s okay. I feel like I’m still getting used to her style. It’s different from my previous therapist.

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s a good insight. Maybe you could create a list of shows that help you relax before bed. Would you be open to trying that? Yeah, I think that could help. I just need to remember to stick to it. It’s perfectly valid to express your needs in therapy. You might say something like, “I appreciate your help, but I’m finding it a bit different than what I’m used to.”  That makes sense. I’ll try to bring it up next time. That’s a common fear, especially in creative fields. Would it help to set small, manageable goals for yourself to ease into it? Yeah, that might work. Like maybe just writing down ideas without judging them? Exactly! Allow yourself the freedom to create without pressure. You can always refine your ideas later.  I like that idea. I’ll try to do that this week."
Next Steps,Honesty can be a powerful tool in relationships. Are there any strategies you think you could use to maintain that openness moving forward? Maybe setting aside time to talk regularly? Like a check-in or something. You’re welcome! Let’s set a goal for next time. Maybe focus on your sleep routine and creative writing? Sounds good to me!
