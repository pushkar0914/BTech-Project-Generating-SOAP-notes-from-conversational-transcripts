History of Present Illness (HPI),"It felt good to take that step, but I still feel anxious about it. I kept thinking, “What if I don’t get a call back?” It’s like a loop in my head. I’ve been trying to remind myself that I’m doing my best, but it’s hard to believe it sometimes. I’ve been writing a little, but I still find it hard to get started. I went for a hike last weekend. It was nice to be outdoors and disconnect for a bit."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"No, I’ve been keeping my distance. It’s just easier that way. It’s a relief, but I also feel guilty sometimes. I guess so. I just feel torn between wanting to support them and needing to take care of myself."

Therapeutic Interventions,It can be challenging to shift our mindset. One technique is to write down those negative thoughts and then counter them with positive affirmations. Would you like to try that? I could give that a shot. It might help to see it on paper. That’s okay! It’s a process. You might try setting a timer for just two minutes and writing whatever comes to mind. No pressure to make it perfect. That sounds manageable. I can try that.
Next Steps,"Yeah, I think I need to make time for that. That sounds like a good plan. Let’s set a goal for you to go hiking or spend time outdoors at least once this week. How does that sound? I can do that! Maybe I could check in once in a while but not get too involved. That sounds like a healthy approach. Checking in can show you care without overwhelming yourself. Would you like to try that this week? Yeah, I think I can manage that."
