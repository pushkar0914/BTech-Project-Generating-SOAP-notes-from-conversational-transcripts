History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I have. I’m still unsure if I want to pursue sports psychology. I’m kind of feeling lost, to be honest. I guess I’m worried about finding a job in that field. And I’m not sure if it’s really what I want anymore. I think I like the idea of making a difference in someone’s life. Like, being there for someone when they need support. Well, I’ve been volunteering at a local community center. It’s been really fulfilling to see the impact we can have on people. I’ve learned that everyone has their struggles, and sometimes just listening can help a lot. It feels good to be that person for someone. I think I’m a pretty good listener. I try to be present and really understand what people are saying. I think I just feel too tired after work and school. It’s hard to find the motivation."
