History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie. I’ve been okay. I tried reaching out to a friend like we talked about. It was a bit awkward at first, but we ended up having a good conversation. He mentioned some job openings he’s heard about. Honestly, it felt good. I was nervous, but I’m glad I did it. I feel less anxious, honestly. It’s nice to get outside and clear my head. Yeah, I talked to her about how I’ve been feeling. She was really supportive, which surprised me. I just told her I was worried and that I wanted to be there for her. She appreciated it and shared some of her feelings too. I think it’s important. I feel like we both needed to talk about it. It’s helped me feel less alone in this. I just love food too much! It’s hard to resist junk food, especially when I’m stressed. I guess I’m just worried about the job search again. I don’t want to get my hopes up."
