History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! It went pretty well. I managed to meditate a few nights, and I used the grounding exercise when I felt anxious. It was a little challenging at first, but I think I’m getting the hang of it. I felt more relaxed afterward. Not really new ones, but I felt a bit anxious during a family gathering. It was a bit overwhelming. I felt much better. I was able to rejoin the gathering without feeling too overwhelmed. Okay. ""Hey everyone, I just wanted to let you know that I love spending time with you all, but sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed in large groups."""

Therapeutic Interventions,"Yes, I used it when I was in a crowded store. It helped me refocus and calm down. I tried to step outside for a few minutes to breathe and collect my thoughts. It helped a lot. I could say, ""I might need to take a short break during the gathering to recharge, and I hope you understand."""
Next Steps,I could talk to them before the next gathering and explain that I might need to step away for a bit.
