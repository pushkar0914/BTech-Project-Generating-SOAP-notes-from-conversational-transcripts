History of Present Illness (HPI),"A bit nervous, honestly. I’ve been out of school for a while, so I’m worried I might struggle. I mentioned it to my mom. She was really supportive and said she’d help me with anything I need. We have a good relationship. I mean, we have our ups and downs, but she’s always there for me. Sometimes I feel like I don’t share enough with her. I want to be more open about my feelings and struggles. I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about everything. It’s like I have so much on my plate, and I worry about balancing it all. I’ve been trying to read more and spend time outdoors, which helps. But sometimes, I just feel overwhelmed. It felt nice. I think I could get used to that. I think my mind races sometimes. I start thinking about everything I need to do the next day. Just the usual worries about being a good mom. I want to make sure I’m doing everything right for my child. I’ve joined some online groups, and they can be really helpful. Hearing from others makes me feel less alone. It’s been a mix of joy and stress. I love my baby, but I sometimes feel overwhelmed."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s okay! It’s normal to feel skeptical about new practices. Would you be open to trying a simple breathing exercise together? Sure, I can try that. No, I haven’t thought of that. That might help clear my mind. It can be very effective. You could try writing down three things you need to do the next day and then set it aside.  That sounds good! I could use that reminder to take care of myself."
Next Steps,"Maybe I could set small goals? Like, just focus on one module at a time instead of the whole course. I think I’ll try to remind myself why I want to do this. Helping children is really important to me. Maybe just starting small, like sharing something that happened during my day or how I’m feeling that day. I’m glad to hear that. It can be a helpful tool to use when you’re feeling anxious. Do you want to set a goal to try it a few times this week? Yeah, I can do that. Just a few minutes each day sounds manageable. No, I haven’t thought of that. That might help clear my mind. It can be very effective. You could try writing down three things you need to do the next day and then set it aside.  I’ll give that a shot!  Self-care is essential, especially as a parent. Let’s set a goal for you to schedule some time for yourself this week. What do you think?"
