History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve had some ups and downs, but overall, I think I’m doing better.   Well, I did reach out to my aunt like we talked about, and it felt really good to talk to her.   It’s a work in progress. Some days I’m better at it than others.   I guess I worry I won’t be good enough or that I’ll face rejection.   I think I’m starting to feel a bit more hopeful, but I still have moments of doubt.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Yes, definitely. I’ve been trying to practice that more.   One thing you could try is limiting screen time before bed, as it can interfere with sleep quality.   It might help to remind yourself that rejection is part of the process and doesn’t define your worth or abilities.   Maybe we could explore more coping strategies for anxiety?  "
Next Steps,"Yes, I think applying to three positions would be a good start.   Definitely! We can work on that. I’ll prepare some techniques for you to try.  "
