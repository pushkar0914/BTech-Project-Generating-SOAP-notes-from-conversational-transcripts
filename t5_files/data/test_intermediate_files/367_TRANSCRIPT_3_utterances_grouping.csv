History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I’ve been okay. I finally sent that message to my family. It was a relief, but I’m also really anxious about their response. Not yet. I’m trying to stay patient, but it’s hard. I’ve been exploring the themes of connection and isolation in my novel. It feels relevant to what I’m experiencing. It’s cathartic, but sometimes it makes me feel more vulnerable. I try to remind myself that it’s part of the process and that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable. I’ve applied to a few more jobs and followed up with some contacts. No responses yet, though. I’m feeling a bit defeated. It’s hard not to take the lack of responses personally. I’ve been reflecting a lot on my last relationship and how it ended. I still feel a lot of guilt about it. I feel like I let her down and that I could have done more to make things work. I think my mental health issues played a big role. I wasn’t in a good place, and I didn’t communicate that well. I’m not sure. I want to, but I worry about repeating the same mistakes."
