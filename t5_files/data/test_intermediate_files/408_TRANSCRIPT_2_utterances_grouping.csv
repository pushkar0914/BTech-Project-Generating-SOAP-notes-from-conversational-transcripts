History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! It was good. I actually had that conversation with my manager, and it went better than I expected! I felt relieved and supported. It was nice to know they care about my well-being. That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you took a significant step in managing your anxiety. Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels since then? Yes, I feel less stressed overall. I’ve been able to focus better on my work. I think it’s just been busy with work, and I haven’t made time to see friends. I miss hanging out with them. I guess I have this fear that they’ll be too busy or that I won’t have anything interesting to say. I think I’ll reach out to my friend Sarah. We used to hang out a lot. I’m a bit nervous but also excited. I really miss our time together."
