History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been okay, a bit stressed, but I did reach out to my dad like we discussed. It was a bit awkward at first, but we ended up having a nice conversation. I shared about school, and he seemed genuinely interested. It felt good! I was nervous, but I’m glad I did it. It made me realize I miss talking to him. I hope so! I want to keep the lines of communication open. I’ve been thinking about my friendships too. I feel like I’m not as close to some of my friends as I used to be. I think it’s just life getting in the way. Everyone is so busy with their own stuff. I haven’t thought of that. I guess I could try! Yeah, I could invite them to grab coffee or something. A little nervous, but I think it would be nice to reconnect. I think they’d be happy to hear from me.  They’ve been helpful, but I still struggle sometimes.  When I have a lot of assignments due at once, I tend to feel overwhelmed and anxious. I’ve heard that advice before, but I often forget to do it when I’m stressed."

Therapeutic Interventions,I think that could help me recharge.  You could try a quick meditation or even a few minutes of deep breathing to reset your mind. That sounds good! I’ll give it a shot.
Next Steps,That might work! I could set reminders on my phone to take breaks and reassess my tasks. I like that! I’ll try to plan short breaks in between my study sessions.
