History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing alright. I actually tried painting like we talked about. It was really nice. I felt relaxed, and it was great to just focus on something creative. I’m so glad to hear that! Did you find it helped with your feelings of being in ""one note land""? Yes, it definitely brightened my mood a bit. I think I’ll keep it up. I did! I approached him like we practiced, and he was surprisingly receptive. He listened, and while he didn’t completely agree, he said he would try to understand my perspective more. It made me feel relieved. I didn’t expect him to be so open. I think I still struggle with feeling like I don’t belong here in L.A. Sometimes I miss home more than I thought I would. I’ve been trying to call my family more often, but it’s still hard. I feel like I’m missing out on things."

Physiological Observations,"It felt good, but I was also drained afterward, which I guess is normal for me now."
Current Functional Status,"Yes, I went to a small gathering and tried to introduce myself to someone new. It was a bit awkward at first, but I managed to talk to someone for a little while. I felt proud of myself. I just took some time to myself afterward. I watched some reality TV to unwind."
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,"I think I’m managing it a bit better. I still have moments, but I feel more equipped to deal with them. I think the breathing exercises and focusing on creativity have made a difference. They help me stay grounded."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Maybe we could look into mindfulness? I’ve heard it can be helpful. Absolutely! Mindfulness can be a powerful tool. Would you like to try a short mindfulness exercise together now? Yes, I’d like that. Let’s take a moment to find a comfortable position. Close your eyes if that feels okay. Focus on your breath. Inhale deeply… hold… and exhale slowly. Just notice how your body feels in this moment. <breathes deeply> It feels calming. Good. As you breathe, try to let go of any thoughts that come to mind. Acknowledge them, then let them drift away like clouds in the sky. I like this. It feels freeing."
Next Steps,"It’s tough to balance those feelings. Perhaps you could plan a visit back home or even organize a family video call to feel more connected? I could definitely try to set up a video call. That might help. That’s wonderful! Mindfulness can help you stay present and reduce anxiety. Would you be willing to practice this a few times a week? Yes, I think I can commit to that."
