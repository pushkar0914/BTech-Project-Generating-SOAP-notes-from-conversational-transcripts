History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, I guess. Still dealing with some of the same stuff. That’s understandable. Last time, we talked about your feelings of isolation and the difficulty you have in trusting people. Have you had any experiences related to that since we last spoke? Well, I did try to reach out to a couple of people online, but it didn’t go as well as I hoped.  I joined a forum about filmmaking, thinking I might connect with some like-minded people, but it felt awkward. I ended up just lurking instead of participating. I guess I just felt like I wouldn’t fit in. It’s like I’m always worried that people won’t like me. Maybe if I had a friend to go with me or someone to talk to before I jump in, I might feel better about it. That’s a great insight. Having a support system can make a big difference. Have you thought about reaching out to someone you trust for that support? I usually just freeze up and don’t know what to say. Wonderful. Let’s also talk about your sleep. You mentioned it’s been difficult for you. Have you noticed any changes since our last session?"

Therapeutic Interventions,"We could work on some strategies together. One idea is to set small, achievable goals. For example, maybe you could aim to post a comment on that forum next week. How does that sound? That’s a common reaction. One technique we can try is grounding exercises. These can help you stay present and calm your mind when you feel anxious. Would you like to try one? It felt nice. I think I could use that when I start feeling anxious. It might be helpful to have a plan for those moments. If you wake up and can’t get back to sleep, you could try getting out of bed and doing a calming activity until you feel sleepy again. How does that sound?"
Next Steps,That sounds doable. I could try that. I’m glad to hear that. You can practice this whenever you need to. Do you think you could incorporate this into your week? I think that could work. I’ll try that. I think I want to try participating in that forum and practice the grounding exercise when I feel anxious.
