History of Present Illness (HPI),um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter>  over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter> positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and
Medical and Psychiatric History,nope no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah  
Psychosocial History,i'm from oklahoma  yup oklahoma city  uh the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter> um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean   i studied psychology and minored in art  um no not at the moment  um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law  i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter> to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends  i've been having some some car trouble lately and i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues  i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time  my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just  she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways  probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter> yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool  uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool  my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and bold and fearless um that i'm unique and artistic and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter>  the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles  oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so i wouldn't really change anything  i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun 
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter>  it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it  should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do 
Physiological Observations,lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function 
Current Functional Status,i've been feeling really good um 
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more  just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>   
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything
