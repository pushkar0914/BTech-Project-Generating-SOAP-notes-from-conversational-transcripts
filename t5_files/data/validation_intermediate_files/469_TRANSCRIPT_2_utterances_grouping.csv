Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,I want to explore my past relationships a bit more. I’ve been thinking about them a lot lately.
Trauma History,Nothing reported

History of Present Illness (HPI),"Laughter is such a great way to bond. Did you feel any anxiety during the hike? Surprisingly, no! I felt pretty relaxed, which is a nice change. Well, I did have a moment of anxiety when I had to deal with a rude customer at work. I felt happy and energized. It reminded me how important those connections are. I keep comparing my past partners to what I want now, and it’s making me feel conflicted. I want to avoid partners who are overly critical or dismissive. I need someone supportive."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing well, actually. I joined that hiking group, and it was amazing! I met some really nice people, and the hike was beautiful. It felt great to be outdoors. It felt refreshing! Everyone was friendly, and we shared some laughs along the way. Yes! I called a friend last week, and we went out for coffee. It was nice to catch up."

Progress Evaluation,That’s wonderful progress! It seems like you’re taking positive steps towards managing your anxiety. Have you been able to maintain that feeling of relaxation since then? I took a deep breath and tried to stay calm. I didn’t let it get to me as much as before. I think I’m getting better at it. I’ve learned to speak up for myself more.
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,I’ve been trying to focus on my breath when I feel overwhelmed. It helps me center myself. I took a short walk during my break and listened to music. It helped me reset.
Next Steps,"I’d like to reach out to another friend I haven’t seen in a while. I think I’ll do that this week. I think I’ll be more upfront about my needs and expectations from the start. I imagine something fun and casual, like going to an amusement park or a fun activity. Maybe reminding myself to just be myself and enjoy the moment, rather than overthinking everything."
