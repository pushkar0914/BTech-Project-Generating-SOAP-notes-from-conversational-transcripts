Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,"I’ve been thinking about going back to therapy again.   I feel like I need more support, especially with everything I’ve been through.   I want to learn how to cope better and maybe find a way to let go of some anger.  "

History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. You mentioned feeling a bit uneasy last time. Has that changed at all?   A little, but I still have those moments where I feel anxious.   I understand. Can you tell me more about what triggers that anxiety for you?   Well, sometimes it’s just random things, like being in crowded places, or even just thinking about the past.   That makes sense. Crowded places can be overwhelming. Have you tried any techniques to manage that anxiety?   That’s a great strategy. How do you feel when you use those techniques?   I feel a little calmer, but it’s not a permanent fix.   I’m sorry to hear that. Have you noticed any specific themes in your nightmares?   That sounds really distressing. How do you cope when you wake up from those nightmares?  "

Psychosocial History,"I also wanted to check in about your relationship with your son. How’s that going?   It’s okay. We have our ups and downs, but I try my best.   What’s been the most challenging part of parenting for you lately?   I think it’s just balancing my own feelings and being there for him.   That’s a tough balance to strike. Have you talked to him about how you’re feeling?   Not really. I don’t want to burden him.   It’s understandable to feel that way, but sometimes sharing a bit can help strengthen your bond.   I guess you’re right. I just don’t want him to worry.   It’s a valid concern. Perhaps you could share small bits, just to let him know you’re human too.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,I’ve been trying to use some deep breathing exercises. They help a bit.   I usually just sit up and try to breathe through it. Sometimes I’ll turn on the TV to distract myself.   That’s a good way to ground yourself. Have you ever considered keeping a journal to write down your feelings after a nightmare?  
Next Steps,"It could be a good way to process those emotions. Would you be willing to give it a try?   Sure, I can try that.   Great! Let’s discuss your progress with the breathing exercises and journaling next time. How does that sound?   I can try that.   Excellent. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable doing that?   Maybe if I write it down first, then I can share it with him.   That sounds like a good plan! Writing can help clarify your thoughts.   Yeah, I’ll give it a shot.   That’s a great goal. Working on coping strategies and processing anger can be very beneficial.   Starting with small steps, like journaling or even talking to someone you trust, can be a good beginning.   I can try that.   I’d like to talk more about my nightmares and maybe how to manage them.
