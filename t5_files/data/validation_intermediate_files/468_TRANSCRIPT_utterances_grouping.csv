Psychosocial History,um redondo beach i like the beach i like the mountains i love how you could go surfing in the morning go snowboarding in the day i like to go hiking up in these mountains santa monica mountains to be exact i don't like the traffic i don't like the congestion of people here the price of <o> the cost of living in specific areas really road tripping and getting out there with my girlfriend um we're looking to go to costa rica and hopefully to south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the south see some of the southern states but uh i've been to canada i've been to mexico and ecuador and been to various states here and there i love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different <diffing> different foods that are native to that local area it's just part of the journey i just i love exploring this you know um just recently we went to seattle and canada with a couple friends and uh it was gorgeous we uh flew into seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy was it gorgeous just the climate was nice the ocean was right there it was people were great it was just a fun trip all around the trip we took to colorado last summer and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people who were living there and um just the day before we had to uh contacted them and telling 'em we're coming in the area and they were just showed great hospitality they picked us up at the airport let us crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their car to explore the state and go to wyoming and the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just every day was there was something new and fun to do i consider myself more outgoing i'm i'm pretty friendly i don't mind to open up to people and stuff <sigh> i like to be outside like to go hiking i like to go um working out at the gym but i mostly like to be outdoors i i love nature and just to be outside just just puts me at ease from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just 'cause there's no need to life's too short for all that see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution not moving to colorado for my undergrad i don't really feel guilty about anything pretty good person i think and for the most part nothing really to be honest i i love all my memories they're usually positive for the most part weird for somebody to say but i've lived a pretty good life and i'm happy uh it's cool um i'm pretty independent for the most part so when i do see 'em here and there it's it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but uh when i see 'em it's it's good you know i like to say hi and show 'em i love 'em still and it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult my girlfriend's family uh they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to and they've been very successful they own their own uh accounting practice and seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life going to maui for a week after graduation i'm fired up i'm fired up to see what the future holds where we gonna live <l> me and my girlfriend gonna live and what other trips are planned for the summer i'm just i'm excited to be done with school for a little while the last time i felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago she had uh just graduated from nursing school on monday and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just 'cause we've been together for six years and seeing her go through seeing all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her probably outgoing friendly positive vibes all around adventurous loves sports team player knows how to be a leader here and there gets a little outspoken sometimes no not really for the most part just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined i went caving two weeks ago uh we went up to sequoia national park and uh i went caving with a for an r_t_m class it's like this uh recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in uh me and these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down into caves climbing back up going through different rooms and chutes ten or twenty years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school a little less on the social aspects sometimes not playing hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and um i'm proud <sigh> that uh i'm really proud that i'm graduating getting my bachelor's and i'm looking to get a full time job i work at a law firm now so i have something going for me  um i'm really proud to be a motivated and determined person long term wise <w> long term thinking wise i'm a well-rounded person and i really wanna explore the world so i'm kinda proud that i opened my eyes to that and now i have different perspectives and really have a open mind to people and rather than judging 'em you know it's liberty why not let 'em do what they want i'm really proud to just be finally getting my bachelor's and hopefully going for my m_b_a in a couple years
