History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's good to hear. Last time, we talked about your feelings towards your living situation and your family. Have you had any thoughts about that since we spoke? Yeah, I have. I think I might want to move out eventually, but I'm not sure if I'm ready yet. That’s a big step. What do you think is holding you back from moving out? I guess it's just the comfort of being around family. Plus, I’m not sure if I can afford it. That makes sense. It’s a significant change. Have you thought about what it would take for you to feel ready to move out? Maybe saving up some money or finding a job that pays better. Those sound like practical steps. Are there any specific jobs you’re considering that might help with that? I’ve been looking at some management positions. They pay better and align with my degree. That sounds promising! Have you applied to any positions yet? It’s therapeutic, honestly. I forget about everything else. I like exercising too. It helps clear my mind. I like running and sometimes hitting the gym. That’s the spirit! Now, let’s talk about your feelings when you get annoyed. You mentioned shutting down. How do you usually handle those moments now? I try to talk it out, but sometimes I just need space. It’s important to recognize what you need in those moments. Have you found any specific techniques that help you express your feelings when you’re annoyed? I’ve been trying to write things down before I talk to someone."

Current Functional Status,"Not yet. I’m still trying to polish my resume. A little, but I’ve been so busy with schoolwork. Have you been able to keep up with your exercise routine lately? Not as much as I’d like. I’ve been too busy."

Therapeutic Interventions,Great! Perhaps we can start with a journaling exercise for the next week. You could write about any moments of annoyance and how you felt.
Next Steps,"That’s a good idea. Would you like to set a goal for applying to a certain number of jobs this week? Sure, I think applying to two or three would be good. Great! We can check in on that next time. How do you feel about that goal? I feel good about it. It seems manageable. Maybe I could set aside an hour a week just for reading or cooking. It’s understandable. Would you like to set a small goal for your exercise routine as well? Yeah, maybe I could aim for two runs this week. That sounds achievable! Let’s check in on that next time too. How do you feel about setting these goals for yourself? I feel good! It gives me something to work towards. Writing can be a powerful tool for processing emotions. Would you like to explore that further? Yeah, I think that could help me articulate my feelings better. That sounds good. I’ll give it a try."
