History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it. I feel like I need to set clearer goals for myself, but I’m not sure where to start. I want to focus on my career and maybe take a few classes to improve my skills with computers. I think that would help me feel more accomplished. I’d like to get better at coding and maybe learn more about cybersecurity. It’s something that really interests me. I found a few online courses, but I haven't signed up for anything yet. That’s where it gets tricky. I want to spend time with my daughter, but I also need to find time for myself. Not yet. I think she might be supportive, but I’m worried she’ll feel like I’m neglecting family time. I feel like I have a lot of potential, but I need to take steps to reach it. I want to take some online courses. Just the usual worries about being a good parent. I want to make sure I’m doing everything right. I guess I compare myself to other parents. I see them doing all these activities with their kids, and I worry."

Next Steps,"Yeah, I think that would help. Maybe by the end of this month? It feels good. I think having a deadline will push me to take action. Maybe I could set aside an hour or two in the evenings after she goes to bed. I could use that time to study. I could explain my goals and how it would ultimately benefit our family if I’m more fulfilled in my career. I would tell her that I’ll still make time for us and our daughter. This is important to me, but family comes first. I feel more confident about it now. It’s nice to have a structure."
