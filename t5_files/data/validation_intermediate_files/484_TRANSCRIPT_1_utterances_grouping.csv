History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been doing okay, I think. A little overwhelmed with school, but managing. That’s understandable. You mentioned feeling emotionally drained last time. Has that changed at all? Mostly about my feelings regarding school and some of the stressors I face. It helps me clarify things in my mind. I’ve noticed that I often write about feeling inadequate or overwhelmed, especially with group projects.  That’s an important insight. How do those feelings of inadequacy affect you in your daily life? They make me hesitant to participate in discussions or share my ideas. I worry that they won’t be good enough. It’s common to feel that way, especially in academic settings. Have you found any strategies that help you push through those feelings? That’s a healthy perspective. How do you feel when you remind yourself of that? I feel a bit lighter, like I can breathe a little easier. But then it’s easy to slip back into doubt. That sounds helpful. I often don’t question those thoughts; I just accept them. Let’s take a recent situation where you felt inadequate. Can you share one? Last week, I had to present in class, and I felt like I stumbled over my words a lot. How did that make you feel afterward? I felt embarrassed and like I failed. Well, I guess I didn’t get any negative feedback, and some classmates even told me I did well."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I’ve been thinking about my relationship with my dad. We don’t talk much, and I feel like I want to reach out more. That’s a significant realization. What has been holding you back from reaching out? I think it’s just the awkwardness of not having spoken in a while. I’m not sure what to say. I like that idea! I could share about my progress in grad school. That sounds like a great way to reconnect! How do you feel about reaching out to him this week? I feel a bit nervous, but I think I’ll do it. "

Progress Evaluation,"That’s a great observation! So, is it fair to say that your initial thought of failing might not be accurate? I see what you mean. I guess I was too hard on myself. I feel good! I appreciate the strategies we talked about."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s great to hear! Can you tell me about how you’ve been using those techniques? Sure! I’ve been doing some breathing exercises before bed, and I’ve also started journaling a bit. It helps me to process my thoughts. Journaling can be a fantastic tool for self-reflection. What have you been writing about? That sounds very productive. Have you noticed any specific patterns or themes in what you’ve been writing? I’ve been trying to remind myself that everyone has something valuable to contribute, and that it’s okay to make mistakes. It’s a process, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. Perhaps we can explore some cognitive-behavioral strategies to help reinforce that positive self-talk. Would you be open to that? Great! One technique is to challenge negative thoughts. When you notice a thought like “I’m not good enough,” you can ask yourself if there’s evidence to support that thought. Exactly! The goal is to create a habit of questioning those thoughts. Can we practice that together?  Now, let’s challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that you failed? It’s a common reaction. Practicing this can help shift your mindset over time. How do you feel about using this technique in the future? It’s understandable to feel that way. Would it help to brainstorm some conversation starters or topics you could discuss? How about starting with something simple, like asking him about his recent activities or sharing something from your life that you’re proud of? That’s a good first step. Remember, it’s about building the connection slowly. You don’t have to cover everything in one conversation."
Next Steps,Excellent! Let’s set a goal for you to try this out over the next week. How does that sound? Sounds good! I’ll try to challenge my negative thoughts when they come up. I’m glad to hear that. Remember to be gentle with yourself as you implement these changes. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
