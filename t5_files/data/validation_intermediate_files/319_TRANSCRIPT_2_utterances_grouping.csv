History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I’ve had some ups and downs, but I tried to implement some of the strategies we discussed. It was a bit freeing, I guess. I didn’t realize how much I was holding in until I wrote it all down. Yes, a lot of my worries revolve around my kids and my own feelings of inadequacy as a parent. I just feel like I’m not doing enough for them, especially when I see their friends achieving things. I worry I’m holding them back somehow. Not really. I guess I’ve been too focused on my own worries. That’s a good point. I think I need to be more supportive rather than critical of myself. I think they’d appreciate it. They’re good kids, and I know they want to make me proud. A little bit. I feel less overwhelmed sometimes, which is nice."
