History of Present Illness (HPI),"Actually, yes! I went to a really great concert last weekend. The energy was amazing. Just being surrounded by people who love the same music. It felt really uplifting. It’s like therapy for me. I can express myself through it, and it helps me relax. Hmm, I think so. There was a day I felt a bit stressed about work, and I put on some of my favorite songs. It really shifted my mood. I’ve been a bit stressed about some upcoming projects at work. It feels like there’s a lot on my plate. Yes, I visited my parents last weekend. It was nice to catch up. We had a great time. We talked about everything, and it felt good to connect."

Current Functional Status,"Yes, I’ve been trying to incorporate music into my daily routine, especially when I feel overwhelmed. I played golf last weekend too! It was a nice way to unwind. It felt refreshing. Being outdoors really helps clear my mind. I try to break things down into smaller tasks, but sometimes it feels overwhelming. I haven’t really done that. I usually just tackle things as they come."

Next Steps,"I think it could help. I like the idea of having a clear plan. Great! Let’s set that as a goal for the week. We can check in on how it worked for you next time.  Maybe exploring more coping strategies for stress and anxiety. I think it could be beneficial. Absolutely! We can focus on that. Would you be open to trying some mindfulness exercises in our next session? Yes, I’d like that!"
