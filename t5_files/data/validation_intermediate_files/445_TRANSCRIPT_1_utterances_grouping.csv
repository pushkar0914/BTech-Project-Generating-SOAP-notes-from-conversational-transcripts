It reminded me that there are things outside of my worries that I can enjoy.  I’ve been listening to music more. It really helps me relax and forget about things for a while.  I haven't really, but that’s a good idea. I used to write songs when I was feeling low.  A few, but they haven’t been as frequent.  I think focusing on the good things in my life has helped.  I’ve been trying to be more aware of it. I still struggle, but I’m working on it.  Yes, there was a minor argument with my girlfriend about household chores.  It felt good.

Next Steps,I want to work on my emotional responses and maybe explore songwriting again.  Those sound like meaningful goals. We can definitely incorporate songwriting into our sessions.  How about we set a goal for you to write a short song or poem about your feelings for next time?  I can do that!
