History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been doing well. I actually tried the breathing exercise with my kids. It worked surprisingly well! They thought it was fun, and it helped calm them down. Yes, I feel like I have more control over those moments now. I think I’ve been more patient overall. I’m trying to be more mindful. Well, I did have a moment with my sister again. I used the “I” statement we practiced. It was a bit rocky at first, but I think it helped her understand where I was coming from. Yes, after the initial tension, we were able to talk it through. It felt good to express my feelings. I feel relieved and proud of myself for addressing it. I’ve been thinking more about my career aspirations and how to get involved with underserved children. I did! I found a couple of local nonprofits that focus on youth mentorship. Exciting and a bit scary. I want to make sure I’m making a positive impact."

Therapeutic Interventions,It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated because the math lesson was confusing? It felt good. I think it’s a powerful way to show that I’m listening.
Next Steps,"Yes, I’m planning to volunteer with one of them next month. I’d like to build relationships with the kids and help them feel valued. I want to be a good listener and provide support. I’ll make it a point to ask open-ended questions and really listen to their responses. I think I’m good at it, but I want to be even better. I think I feel ready to volunteer and practice these skills."
