"It’s tough when you’re putting in the effort and not seeing results. Remember, it’s a process. Have you considered reaching out to any contacts or networking?",T,Insignificant
I haven’t really thought about that.,P,Insignificant

Exploring those options is a great step. What’s holding you back from signing up?,T,Insignificant
I guess I’m just nervous about meeting new people.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common feeling. It can be intimidating to step outside your comfort zone. What if you approached it as a chance to enjoy something you love rather than focusing on the social aspect?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
