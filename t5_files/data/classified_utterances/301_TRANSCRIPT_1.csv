"Hi, it's Ellie again. How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"Hey, I've been alright, thanks for asking.",P,Insignificant
"That's good to hear. Last time, we talked about your job situation and how you feel about it. Have there been any updates or changes since then?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Not really, still working as an administrative assistant. Just trying to keep my head above water.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I understand. Have you had any opportunities to explore other job options or creative ventures?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"A few, but nothing concrete. I’ve been thinking about starting a small side project, maybe something creative, but I’m not sure yet.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a positive step. What kind of project are you considering?,T,Insignificant
"I’m not entirely sure. Maybe something with music or art, since I have friends in those areas. Just something to express myself, you know?",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds promising! What’s holding you back from starting that project?,T,Insignificant
I guess it’s just the usual fear of failure. What if it doesn’t go anywhere?,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common concern. What would it mean for you if the project didn’t succeed?,T,Insignificant
"I suppose it would feel like a waste of time, and I don’t want to disappoint myself or my friends.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s understandable to feel that way. But what if we reframe that thought? What if you viewed it as an opportunity to learn rather than a failure?,T,Insignificant
I guess that could work. It’s just hard to shake off the fear.,P,Insignificant
"Absolutely, and it’s okay to feel that fear. Have you had any past experiences where trying something new led to unexpected outcomes?",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I mean, I tried out for a band once, and even though I didn’t get in, it was fun and I met some cool people.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a great example! It sounds like you gained some valuable experiences from that, even if it didn’t turn out how you hoped.",T,Insignificant
"True, I guess I should focus more on the experience rather than the outcome.",P,Insignificant
Exactly! How do you think you can apply that mindset to your potential project?,T,Insignificant
"Maybe I could set smaller goals for myself, like just creating something without worrying about how it will be received.",P,Next Steps
That sounds like a fantastic plan. Smaller goals can help reduce the pressure and make it more enjoyable. What’s a small goal you could set for yourself this week?,T,Next Steps
I could try to write a song or create a piece of art. Just something to get the ball rolling.,P,Next Steps
That’s a wonderful idea! How do you feel about committing to that?,T,Insignificant
I feel good about it. It sounds manageable.,P,Insignificant
"Great! I’m excited to hear how that goes. Now, let’s talk a bit about your temper. You mentioned you’ve been working on controlling it. How has that been going for you?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Honestly, it’s been a mixed bag. Some days I feel like I’m doing well, and other days, I just lose it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s okay to have ups and downs. Can you think of a recent situation where you felt your temper flaring?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, just the other day, I was driving and someone cut me off. I was so angry I almost yelled at them.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds frustrating! How did you handle that anger in that moment?,T,Insignificant
I just took a deep breath and tried to let it go. I didn’t want to escalate things.,P,Mental Health Observations
That’s a great strategy! It shows that you’re making progress in managing your reactions. What do you think triggered your anger in that situation?,T,Insignificant
I think it’s just the stress of everyday life. Sometimes it feels like everything is just piling up.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Have you thought about any additional coping strategies you could use when you feel that stress building?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to exercise more, like running or going to the gym, but I think I need to incorporate some mindfulness too.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Mindfulness can be very helpful! Would you be open to trying some mindfulness exercises this week?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, I can give it a shot. Maybe some breathing exercises or meditation.",P,Therapeutic Interventions

I can do that. It might help with the stress and my temper.,P,Next Steps
"Absolutely! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. As we wrap up today, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss?",T,Insignificant
"Not really, I feel like we covered a lot today.",P,Insignificant
