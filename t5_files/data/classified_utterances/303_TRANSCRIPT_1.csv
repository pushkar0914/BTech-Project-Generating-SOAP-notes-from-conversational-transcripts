It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you thought about how you could approach those conversations differently?,T,Insignificant
Maybe I could listen more instead of just giving advice. I guess she needs to feel heard too.,P,Progress Evaluation

I think that could work. It might help her feel understood.,P,Progress Evaluation
Exactly! And it can open the door for her to share more. What else do you think might help in your relationship with her?,T,Insignificant
