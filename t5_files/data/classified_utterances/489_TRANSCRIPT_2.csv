I think I’ll keep doing them. They really make a difference.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Fantastic! Have you noticed any changes in your mood since starting these practices?,T,Insignificant

I’ve been thinking about how to handle negative thoughts. Sometimes I get stuck in a loop.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common challenge. Would you like to explore cognitive behavioral techniques to address those thoughts?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yes, that sounds helpful.",P,Insignificant
Great! One technique is identifying cognitive distortions—like all-or-nothing thinking or catastrophizing. Have you noticed any patterns in your negative thoughts?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I think I sometimes jump to conclusions or assume the worst.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Recognizing that is a great first step. When you catch yourself doing that, try to challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself what evidence supports or contradicts them.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I’ll try that. It makes sense to question my thoughts.,P,Insignificant
"Exactly! It’s about creating a dialogue with yourself. The next time you notice a negative thought, write it down and then write a counter-thought.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I like that idea. I’ll give it a shot.,P,Insignificant
