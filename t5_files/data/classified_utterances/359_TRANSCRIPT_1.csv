Hi again! It’s nice to see you. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Hey Ellie! I’ve been okay, I guess. Still trying to get through the days. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I understand. You mentioned feeling pretty low last time. Have you noticed any changes in your mood since then?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Not really. It’s like I’m stuck in this rut. I still feel blah most of the time. I try to keep busy, but it’s hard.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That makes sense. Keeping busy can sometimes help, but it sounds like you might still be feeling overwhelmed. Have you had a chance to write at all since we last spoke?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Not really. I keep thinking about it, but I just can’t seem to get the words down. I feel like I’m losing that spark.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s understandable, especially if you’re feeling low. What do you think is holding you back from writing?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I think it’s just that I don’t feel inspired. Like, I have ideas, but I can’t get excited about them. It’s frustrating.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds frustrating indeed. Would you like to explore some ways to spark that inspiration again? ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’d love to. I miss that feeling of creating something.",P,Insignificant
Great! One technique that might help is free writing. It’s where you write without worrying about grammar or structure—just let your thoughts flow. Have you ever tried that?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"I haven’t, but it sounds interesting. ",P,Insignificant
It can be liberating! You could set a timer for ten minutes and just write whatever comes to mind. Would you be open to trying that this week?,T,Next Steps
"Sure, I can give that a shot. ",P,Next Steps
"Awesome! And remember, there’s no pressure to create something perfect. It’s just about getting the words out. ",T,Insignificant
That makes sense. Maybe I’ll try it tonight.,P,Next Steps
Perfect! How about we check in on that in our next session? ,T,Next Steps
Sounds good. ,P,Insignificant
"Last time, you mentioned feeling angry about people who don’t seem to help themselves. Have you noticed any situations that have triggered that anger lately?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, actually. I was at a grocery store and saw someone begging outside. It just made me so mad. I wanted to shout at them to get a job.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a strong reaction. What do you think lies behind that anger?,T,Insignificant
"I guess I just don’t understand why some people don’t try harder. I’ve had my struggles, but I’ve always tried to make things work.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s understandable to feel that way. It might help to explore how your own experiences shape your perspective on this. Would you like to delve into that?,T,Insignificant
"Sure, I think that could help.",P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s start by discussing your own struggles. You mentioned having a gambling addiction. How do you think that experience influences your views on responsibility?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Well, I know I messed up, but I always tried to get back on my feet. I guess I just feel like if I can do it, others should too.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a powerful perspective. It shows your resilience. However, it’s also important to recognize that everyone’s circumstances are different. Some people may face challenges you haven’t experienced.",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I get that. It’s just hard to watch.",P,Insignificant
It is hard. Would it help to think about ways to channel that anger into something constructive?,T,Insignificant
"Maybe. I’ve thought about volunteering or something, but I never follow through.",P,Next Steps
That could be a great outlet for you! It might help you feel more connected to your community and give you a sense of purpose. Would you like to explore some volunteer opportunities together?,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I’d be open to that.",P,Next Steps
"Wonderful! We can look into it next time. For now, how about focusing on your writing and seeing how that goes? ",T,Next Steps
Sounds like a plan.,P,Insignificant
"Before we wrap up, how have you been sleeping lately?",T,Physiological Observations
"About the same. I still have those nights where I can’t get to sleep, but I’ve been trying to stay in a routine.",P,Physiological Observations
That’s good to hear. Establishing a routine can really help. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed?,T,Insignificant
I haven’t really looked into it. ,P,Insignificant
Would you be interested in trying some mindfulness exercises? They can be helpful for calming your mind before sleep.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I think I’d like that.",P,Insignificant
"Great! I can share a simple breathing exercise with you. It’s just focusing on your breath, inhaling for four counts, holding for four, and exhaling for four. ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds doable.,P,Insignificant
Perfect! Let’s try to incorporate that into your bedtime routine and see if it helps. ,T,Next Steps
I’ll give it a go.,P,Next Steps
I’m glad to hear that. Thank you for sharing today. Let’s check in on your writing and sleep techniques next session. ,T,Next Steps
"Thanks, Ellie. I appreciate it.",P,Insignificant
"You’re welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.",T,Insignificant
