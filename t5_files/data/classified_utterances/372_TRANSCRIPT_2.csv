Hello! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been trying to stick to my goals, but it’s been a bit of a struggle.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Can you share more about what you’ve experienced while trying to focus on your journal and grounding exercises?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I started journaling more positively, but I still find myself slipping back into negative thoughts. It’s frustrating.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s completely normal to experience those setbacks. What do you think triggers those negative thoughts when you’re journaling?,T,Insignificant
I think it’s when I reflect on my custody situation. It just brings up so many fears and insecurities.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Those feelings are valid. It’s a significant source of stress. Have you considered writing about those fears as well, perhaps exploring them more deeply?",T,Insignificant
"I haven’t, but that might help. If I acknowledge them, maybe they won’t feel so overwhelming.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That could be a helpful approach. Writing about your fears can sometimes help to demystify them. How have the grounding exercises been going for you?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been practicing them, and I do feel calmer afterward. But I still forget to do them when I’m really stressed.",P,Current Functional Status
It takes time to build a habit. Maybe setting a reminder on your phone could help you remember to practice when you feel anxious?,T,Insignificant
That’s a good idea! I could set it for times when I know I’m usually stressed.,P,Insignificant
Perfect! It’s all about finding what works for you. Have you had any moments recently where you felt particularly anxious?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, there was a day last week when I got into a big argument with my husband. I felt so overwhelmed afterward.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I’m sorry to hear that. Arguments can be really draining. What was the argument about, if you don’t mind sharing?",T,Insignificant
"We were arguing about my sister again. He feels like she’s too much of a burden, and I just want him to understand my side.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like there’s a lot of tension in your living situation. How did you feel during and after the argument?,T,Insignificant
"I felt angry and frustrated. Afterward, I just felt guilty for not being able to communicate better.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Guilt can be a heavy emotion. It’s important to remember that arguments are part of relationships. Have you thought about how you might communicate your feelings to him in a different way next time?,T,Insignificant
I think I need to be more assertive. I often just go along with what he wants to avoid conflict.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great insight. Assertive communication can help you express your needs while still being respectful. Would you like to practice some assertive statements together?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, that would be helpful!",P,Insignificant
"Let’s try this. Imagine you want to express how you feel about your sister living with you. You could say, “I feel overwhelmed when my sister is here because…” How would you finish that sentence?",T,Insignificant
I feel overwhelmed when my sister is here because it adds extra stress to my day-to-day life.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a strong start! You’re expressing your feelings while also taking ownership of them. How does that feel to say?,T,Insignificant
It feels empowering. I wish I could say that to him without feeling guilty.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a common feeling. It can be challenging to express our needs, especially when we care about others. Remember, your feelings are valid, and you deserve to communicate them.",T,Insignificant
I’ll keep that in mind. I want to work on being more assertive.,P,Insignificant
"That’s a fantastic goal! As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you want to focus on before our next session?",T,Insignificant
I want to practice assertive communication with my husband and keep journaling positively.,P,Next Steps
"Those are excellent goals! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next week. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re doing great.",T,Insignificant
"Thank you, Ellie. I appreciate your help.",P,Insignificant
"You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next week.",T,Insignificant
Bye!,P,Insignificant
Bye!,T,Insignificant
