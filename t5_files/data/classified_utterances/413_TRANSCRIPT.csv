<tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california,P,Psychosocial History
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a,T,Insignificant
um initially it was easy because i felt like,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
how different it is and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what life is out here it became more difficult than originally,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting,P,Psychosocial History
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
that's a interesting question,P,Insignificant
i guess just my childhood in general,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
growing up,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
um well my family's very close,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live,P,Psychosocial History
within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that,P,Psychosocial History
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is,P,Psychosocial History
more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
um i consider myself more shy,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
like what,T,Insignificant
um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh huh,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
insignificant things,P,Insignificant
but other than that,P,Insignificant
um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
there's been like some tension going on,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
things about his girlfriend and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so for like the thirtieth time he,P,Insignificant
we were on the phone and he was,P,Insignificant
<sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sucks,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but the thing is is that he says,P,Insignificant
certain things that are untrue,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
or things he knows that like will tick me off,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that are really nasty and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that he shouldn't be saying to me so he,P,Insignificant
so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mm like not say anything,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't,P,Insignificant
i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to,P,Insignificant
after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now,P,Insignificant
that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i wish i could erase,P,Insignificant
the event or seeing,P,Insignificant
my grandmother's funeral which,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
obviously it wouldn't change anything,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
it wasn't,P,Insignificant
seeing her there was not something i'd wanna,P,Insignificant
like have in my memory,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
um she was she was a very positive influence and always,P,Psychosocial History
was not judgmental,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people,P,Psychosocial History
so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people,P,Insignificant
they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you,P,Psychosocial History
are older,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep,P,Physiological Observations
no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m,P,Physiological Observations
i will be up like clockwork,P,Physiological Observations
by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to,P,Physiological Observations
figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer,P,Physiological Observations
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
no i just,P,Insignificant
in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's,P,Physiological Observations
i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning,P,Physiological Observations
hmm,T,Insignificant
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
<tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring,P,Physiological Observations
but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday,P,Physiological Observations
okay,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know i kind of just feel very,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mm,P,Insignificant
like so so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
just,P,Insignificant
no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
one note land,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
i mean nothing like lately,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
just reserved and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
not very outgoing,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no i have been diagnosed with anxiety,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety,P,History of Present Illness (HPI): Medical and Psychiatric History
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Insignificant
i think in the right setting and,P,Insignificant
with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist,P,Insignificant
is helpful,P,Insignificant
and good at what they're doing then yeah,P,Insignificant
do you still go to therapy now,T,Insignificant
no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
why did you stop,T,Insignificant
um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like,P,Insignificant
deal with whatever issues they were having with me,P,Insignificant
but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day,P,Insignificant
it wasn't,P,Insignificant
i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
<sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
when i'm there i can always just,P,Insignificant
we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to,P,Insignificant
worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out,P,Insignificant
just enjoy the day,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
in general,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that it was more like a transfer school like you,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
so it kind of create created more problems for me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago,P,Insignificant
i would give myself the advice to,P,Insignificant
probably stay closer to home,P,Insignificant
and to have,P,Insignificant
really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
my best friend would describe me,P,Psychosocial History
as a great charismatic funny outgoing,P,Psychosocial History
socially enjoyable person which is different than how,P,Insignificant
people who aren't my good friends would describe me,P,Psychosocial History
which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i,P,Insignificant
am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i am very shy and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
don't really,P,Insignificant
speak much,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed,T,Insignificant
um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
nice,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm very caring,P,Psychosocial History
i,P,Insignificant
i'm a very good judge of character,P,Psychosocial History
which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm very affectionate <aff>,P,Psychosocial History
i mean,P,Insignificant
i'm not very affectionate i'm more,P,Insignificant
