"Hi Ellie! I've been okay, I guess. Just the usual ups and downs.",P,Insignificant
"I understand. Last time we talked about your feelings of being in ""one note land."" Have you noticed any changes in that?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Not really. I still feel kind of flat. I try to shake it off, but it lingers.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Well, I did go to that basketball game with my friend again, and it was fun. But it was just a temporary high.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s great that you had a good time at the game! What do you think keeps you from feeling that excitement more often?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I think it’s just life here. Sometimes it feels like a routine, and I’m not sure how to break out of it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

I feel good about it. It might help me clear my mind.,P,Next Steps
"Fantastic! Let’s check in about that in our next session. Now, you mentioned feeling more reserved and secluded over the years. Can you share more about that?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, I just find myself not wanting to go out as much. I used to be more social, but now it feels exhausting.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s common for social energy to fluctuate. Do you think there’s anything specific that triggers that exhaustion for you?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)

Let’s take a deep breath in for four counts… hold for four… and exhale for four. Repeat that a few times. How does that feel?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"It feels calming, actually. I think I should try this before I go out next time.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a great idea! Practicing it regularly can help you feel more centered. What other strategies do you think might help you in social situations?,T,Next Steps
"Maybe I could try to set smaller goals, like just talking to one new person instead of feeling like I have to mingle with everyone.",P,Next Steps

"Yes, I think I’ll aim to introduce myself to one new person at the next event I attend.",P,Next Steps
Perfect! I’m excited to hear how that goes. Is there anything else on your mind today that you’d like to discuss?,T,Insignificant
I guess just the ongoing tension with my dad. It’s still bothering me.,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
That’s understandable. Would you like to explore that further?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think it would help. I just feel like we’re stuck in this cycle of arguing.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds frustrating. What do you think contributes to that cycle?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I think it’s a mix of misunderstandings and him pushing me to do things I’m not comfortable with.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It might be helpful to communicate your feelings more directly to him. Have you thought about how you might approach that conversation?,T,Next Steps
I haven’t really figured that out yet. I’m not sure he would listen.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It can be challenging, but expressing your feelings calmly might open the door for a better understanding. Would you like to role-play that conversation here?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That could be useful. I’d like to see how I might phrase things.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Great! Let’s start with how you might express your feelings about the situation without placing blame.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Okay, I would say something like, “Dad, I feel overwhelmed when you tell me to reach out to her. It makes me feel pressured.”",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a good start! It’s important to express how you feel. How do you think he might respond to that?,T,Insignificant
"He might get defensive, but maybe it would help him see my side.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s possible. Remember, you can’t control his reaction, but you can control how you express yourself. Would you feel ready to try that in real life?",T,Next Steps
I think I could try it. It’s worth a shot.,P,Next Steps
