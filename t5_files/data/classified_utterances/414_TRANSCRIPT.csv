so i told my friend,P,Insignificant
what i was feeling,P,Insignificant
and that she needed to take me to the e_r,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and from the e_r i had the choice to,P,Insignificant
i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

um,P,Insignificant
<exhale> it was awful,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just,P,Insignificant
start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was,P,Insignificant
mostly men and um they were all really old,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

it was really hard for me <laughter>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

i wasn't talking to any of my friends and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i was,P,Insignificant
drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i was just in a really bad place,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

i guess just,P,Insignificant
sometimes they reflect,P,Insignificant
things that i'm worried about,P,Insignificant
or happening in my life but they're just,P,Insignificant
they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

i mean i think i've,P,Insignificant
done a lot of great things in my life,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
i have achieved a lot,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
i think one of the proudest things,P,Insignificant
proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant,P,Insignificant
i was doing this exercise boot camp and,P,Insignificant
the last person to like cross the finish line had to do like,P,Insignificant
thirty push ups and,P,Insignificant
it was some guy i didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone wanna help him if someone helps him you have to do half each,P,Insignificant
and no one wanted to help him and i just decided to start doing push ups with him,P,Insignificant
and i just,P,Insignificant
it wasn't 'cause i wanted to get credit or because i thought it would make me look good i just did it,P,Insignificant
and no one really knows about that but it just i feel really good about that,P,Insignificant
