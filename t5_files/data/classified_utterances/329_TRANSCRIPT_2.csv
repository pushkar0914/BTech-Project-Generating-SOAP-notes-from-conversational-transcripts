Hi! It’s great to see you again. How have things been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"Hi! I’ve been okay, a bit busy, but I did ask for help from my colleague like we talked about.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! How did that go for you?  ,T,Insignificant
"It went really well! They were more than happy to help, and it took a lot of pressure off me.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I’m so glad to hear that! How did it feel to reach out for support?  ,T,Insignificant
"It felt liberating, honestly. I realized I don’t have to do everything alone.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a powerful realization. It sounds like you’re building your confidence in asking for help. Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels since then?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Definitely! I feel less overwhelmed and more capable of managing my workload.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful progress! Are there any other areas in your life where you feel you could use support?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I could use some support with setting boundaries. I sometimes say yes to too many things.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Setting boundaries is essential for maintaining balance. What situations do you find yourself saying yes when you’d prefer to say no?  ,T,Insignificant
Usually when friends ask me to hang out or when clients want extra sessions.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s important to evaluate your priorities. How do you feel when you overcommit yourself?  ,T,Insignificant
"I feel drained and sometimes resentful, which isn’t fair to anyone.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Absolutely. It’s important to honor your own needs. Let’s discuss how you can communicate your boundaries effectively.  ,T,Insignificant
That sounds good.  ,P,Insignificant
One approach could be to practice saying no in low-stakes situations first. Can you think of a recent scenario where you could have said no?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes! A friend asked me to join an event I wasn’t really interested in, but I felt guilty saying no.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a perfect example. How might you respond in the future?  ,T,Insignificant
"I could say something like, “Thanks for the invite, but I need some time for myself.”  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s an excellent response! It’s honest and respects your needs. Would you like to set a goal to practice this in the upcoming week?  ,T,Next Steps
"Yes, I’d like to try that!  ",P,Next Steps
Great! Let’s check in on your progress next session. Is there anything else you’d like to work on today?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve also been thinking about my meditation practice. I want to deepen it.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a wonderful intention. What aspects of your practice would you like to explore further?  ,T,Insignificant
Maybe trying different techniques or styles. I’ve mostly stuck to the same routine.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Exploring new techniques can bring fresh energy to your practice. Would you like to set a goal to try a new meditation style this week?  ,T,Next Steps
"Yes, I’d love that!  ",P,Next Steps
Fantastic! Let’s plan to discuss how that goes next time. Thank you for sharing your journey with me today.  ,T,Insignificant
Thank you! I appreciate your guidance.  ,P,Insignificant
I’m excited to see your progress next session. Take care until then!  ,T,Insignificant
Goodbye!  ,P,Insignificant
