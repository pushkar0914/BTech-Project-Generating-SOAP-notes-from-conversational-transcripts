Hi there! It’s great to see you again. How has your week been?,T,Insignificant
"Hey, Ellie. It’s been alright, I guess. I tried that pause technique we talked about.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! How did it go for you?,T,Insignificant
"Honestly, it was a mixed bag. There were moments when I remembered to pause, and others where I forgot completely.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s completely normal! It’s all part of the learning process. Can you share a specific situation where you used the technique?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, there was a moment when I was playing video games with friends, and one of them made a joke about my skills. I felt that anger creeping in, but I took a breath and paused. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great example! How did your friends respond when you took that moment?,T,Insignificant
"They were surprised at first, but then I just laughed it off instead of flipping out. It felt good.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a wonderful outcome! It sounds like you were able to redirect the situation positively. What do you think helped you remember to pause in that moment?,T,Insignificant
I think I was just really aware of how I didn’t want to react like I used to. It was like I had a little voice in my head reminding me.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That awareness is key! It shows that you’re making progress. Were there any situations where you didn’t remember to pause?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, there was one time when I got really mad at my roommate over something dumb. I just exploded.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s okay to have those moments too. What do you think triggered that anger?,T,Insignificant
"It was just a buildup of stuff. I felt like he wasn’t respecting my space, and it just boiled over.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like there might be some underlying feelings there. Have you had a chance to talk to your roommate about it since that incident?,T,Insignificant
"No, not yet. I’m kind of avoiding it because I feel embarrassed.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s understandable. However, addressing it could help clear the air. Would you like to discuss how you might approach that conversation?",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I need to. I don’t want to keep feeling this way.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a great mindset. How about starting with expressing how you felt during that moment? You could say something like, “I felt overwhelmed when…”",T,Insignificant
That sounds good. I’ll try that.,P,Insignificant
"Excellent! Remember, it’s okay to express your feelings. It can lead to a better understanding between you both. Is there anything else you’d like to work on today?",T,Insignificant

That’s a valuable insight. Let’s explore that. Can you think of any patterns or situations that often lead to your anger?,T,Insignificant
I guess it’s mostly when I feel disrespected or ignored. Like I’m not being taken seriously.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
