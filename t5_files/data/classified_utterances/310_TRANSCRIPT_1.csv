Hi again! It’s great to see you back. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"Oh, you know, just the usual. Not much has changed.  ",P,Insignificant
"I see. Last time, we talked about your living situation and how you feel about having roommates. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke?  ",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, it still sucks. I just need my own place, you know?  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds frustrating. Have you considered any steps towards finding your own space?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Not really. I mean, it’s expensive here. I can barely afford what I have.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. It can be tough in such a high-cost area. What do you think would help you feel more at ease in your current situation?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I guess just more alone time. I wish I could just lock myself in a room sometimes.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. Have you found any ways to carve out that alone time?  ,T,Current Functional Status
"A little. I just try to be out when they’re around, but it’s not always possible.  ",P,Current Functional Status
"It sounds like you’re doing what you can. Speaking of alone time, you mentioned enjoying music on vinyl last time. Have you had any opportunities to listen to music lately?  ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’ve been digging into my collection a bit more. It’s relaxing.  ",P,Current Functional Status
That’s wonderful! What kind of music have you been enjoying?  ,T,Insignificant
"Mostly classic rock, some punk. Just things that take me back, you know?  ",P,Insignificant
Nostalgia can be a powerful feeling. How does that music make you feel?  ,T,Insignificant
"It just feels good. Like a time capsule, I guess.  ",P,Insignificant
That’s a beautiful way to describe it. Do you think music helps improve your mood when you’re feeling down?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Definitely. It’s like an escape.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s great to hear. Have you noticed any specific times when music has helped you recently?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, I was feeling kind of low last week, and I put on some old albums. It helped a lot.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I’m glad to hear that. It sounds like you have a healthy coping mechanism. Have you thought about other activities that could help lift your spirits?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Maybe. I used to like drawing, but I haven’t done that in a while.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Drawing can be a wonderful outlet. What do you think has stopped you from picking it up again?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I don’t know. Just lost interest, I guess.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Sometimes interests shift. What if we set a small goal for you to try drawing again this week?  ,T,Next Steps
I could try. It might be nice to get back into it.  ,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a positive step! How about setting aside just 10-15 minutes a few times this week to doodle or sketch?  ,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I can do that.  ",P,Next Steps
Great! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. You mentioned feeling down sometimes. Are there specific triggers that you’ve noticed?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Just the usual stuff. Work, living situation, not having friends around.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Those are valid concerns. Have you thought about ways to connect with others, even if it’s just online?  ",T,Next Steps
"I’ve tried, but it’s hard to find people I click with.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That makes sense. It’s important to find the right fit. Would you be open to exploring new social avenues, like local meetups or hobby groups?  ",T,Next Steps
Maybe. I’m not sure how comfortable I’d feel in a group.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. We can take it slow. How about just researching some options this week?  ,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I could do that.  ",P,Next Steps
"Perfect! It’s all about taking small steps. So, what’s one thing you’re looking forward to this week?  ",T,Insignificant
"Uh, I guess just trying to get back into drawing and listening to some new music.  ",P,Insignificant
"That sounds like a good plan! I hope it brings you joy. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss?  ",T,Insignificant
Not really. I think we covered a lot.  ,P,Insignificant
"I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I look forward to hearing about your drawing next time.  ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, me too. Thanks!  ",P,Insignificant
You’re welcome! See you next time!  ,T,Insignificant
Bye!  ,P,Insignificant
