"Not really. Still looking for work, but it’s tough out there.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds frustrating. Have you had any interviews or opportunities since we last spoke?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"A couple, but nothing really came of them. Just feels like I’m going in circles.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
