hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
so how are you doing today,T,Insignificant
oh um fine a little tired but uh i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so <laughter>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh oh,T,Insignificant
where are you from originally,T,Insignificant
i was born in canada,P,Psychosocial History
really,T,Insignificant
and but i've lived in california most of my life so,P,Psychosocial History
and it's grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda um you know sluggish,P,Physiological Observations
when did you move to l_a,T,Insignificant
the <laughter>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
when did you move to l_a,T,Insignificant
oh my gosh years and years ago,P,Psychosocial History
how often do you go back to your hometown,T,Insignificant
uh not at all i don't think i've gone back there <laughter> for a long time,P,Psychosocial History
why,T,Insignificant
well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so,P,Insignificant
travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost prohibitive so,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
uh huh,P,Insignificant
how does it compare to l_a,T,Insignificant
oh let's see everything has plus and minuses um cold weather <laughter> not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that,P,Psychosocial History
it's um it's very pretty back there natural scenery and,P,Psychosocial History
but uh i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with,P,Psychosocial History
so,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
why did you move to l_a,T,Insignificant
why did i move to l_a because my family came here and started uh my dad got a job here and,P,Psychosocial History
this became our home base and uh,P,Psychosocial History
that's why,P,Insignificant
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a,T,Insignificant
easy very easy so,P,Psychosocial History
that's good,T,Insignificant
uh huh,P,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
uh well in high school you generally study general ed yeah it's they have designated courses and then after that,P,Insignificant
went to college and i was a business major let's see i was a veterinary major <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so,P,Psychosocial History
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
can't really pinpoint why <laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
are you still working in that,T,Insignificant
i was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate,P,Psychosocial History
i'm a leasing consultant part time,P,Psychosocial History
are you happy you did that,T,Insignificant
i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
oh,P,Insignificant
probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at,P,Psychosocial History
t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
(laughter,T,Insignificant
but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so,P,Psychosocial History
but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um,P,Insignificant
take a walk uh call my friends,P,Insignificant
million things <laughter> so,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mhm,T,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i can't really remember,P,Insignificant
so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of,P,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i can't think of anything right now,P,Insignificant
hmm,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard,P,Insignificant
i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision,P,Insignificant
so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s>  to san francisco for a job once but,P,Psychosocial History
since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and,P,Psychosocial History
that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider,P,Psychosocial History
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
an event,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever,P,Trauma History
so i know when my father died you know i mean,P,Trauma History
i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more,P,Trauma History
yeah,T,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with,P,Insignificant
that,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
there are always trade-offs in life aren't there,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh,P,Insignificant
philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do,P,Psychosocial History
um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot,P,Psychosocial History
i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them,P,Psychosocial History
so,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
mhm we have a small family,P,Psychosocial History
what do you think of today's kids,T,Insignificant
uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many,P,Insignificant
types of kids out there i think,P,Insignificant
majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control,P,Insignificant
but um,P,Insignificant
i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very,P,Insignificant
well-behaved so can't say much else about that,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um,P,Insignificant
uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but,P,Insignificant
they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes,P,Physiological Observations
run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't,P,Insignificant
oh no,T,Insignificant
yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting,P,Physiological Observations
ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll,P,Physiological Observations
kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so,P,Physiological Observations
i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter>,P,Physiological Observations
but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's,P,Insignificant
i can't say anything to her about that,P,Insignificant
that sucks,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know,P,Insignificant
at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but,P,Insignificant
for now you know that's i'll deal with it so,P,Insignificant
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but,P,Physiological Observations
the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so,P,Physiological Observations
you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep,P,Physiological Observations
uh huh,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean,P,Physiological Observations
so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that,P,Physiological Observations
right,T,Insignificant
i um,P,Insignificant
i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know,P,Insignificant
whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and,P,Insignificant
you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so,P,Physiological Observations
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no mm mm,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
no i never regret anything,P,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
uh huh,P,Insignificant
what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it,P,Insignificant
everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um,P,Insignificant
you know seems like <laughter>,P,Insignificant
uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um,P,Insignificant
wasted time with certain people um,P,Insignificant
i don't know those are the things that come to mind,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh,P,Psychosocial History
i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so,P,Psychosocial History
that's good,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i understand,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter>,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
but uh if you want i'll repeat it so,P,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable,P,Psychosocial History
uh,P,Insignificant
i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener,P,Psychosocial History
and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm,P,Psychosocial History
don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mhm,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
that's a hard question <laughter> the,P,Insignificant
can't think i mean i'm,P,Insignificant
can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter>,P,Insignificant
what are some things you like to do for fun,T,Insignificant
for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um,P,Psychosocial History
i love going out with my friends,P,Psychosocial History
shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
that's kind of,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
part of it yeah that i mentioned so,P,Insignificant
what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it,P,Psychosocial History
um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries,P,Psychosocial History
uh the architecture,P,Psychosocial History
it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
okay well <laughter> i've um been,P,Insignificant
to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh it's such a walking city you can,P,Psychosocial History
whoever designed that city i'll tell ya i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great um,P,Psychosocial History
each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are,P,Psychosocial History
there's another area where let's say the fashion designers are um,P,Psychosocial History
kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african <af> african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international,P,Psychosocial History
mm,T,Insignificant
and then like i said once you get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles then there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know it's,P,Psychosocial History
but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so,P,Psychosocial History
wow,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college,P,Psychosocial History
that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and,P,Psychosocial History
um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit  you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not <laughter> not a big deal um,P,Psychosocial History
so yeah that's,P,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
