i'm sorry,T,Insignificant

that's great,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant

can you give me an example of that,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i should've went to law school,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

i was accepted i just didn't i had other other things i thought i wanted to do <snort>,P,Insignificant
like what,T,Insignificant
uh <sigh> uh i i played with uh wanting to be uh uh a kicker for football on a football team,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
had some tryouts things like that,P,Insignificant
but they didn't pan out,P,Insignificant
and as as that didn't pan out i sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer,P,Insignificant
so i just did other things,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant

has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
it has in the past yeah <snort>,P,Insignificant
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself,T,Insignificant
well i have this theory that you could make me feel bad about myself only if i let you,P,Insignificant

when she left me with the children <snort> she you know that it was my fault,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
and i wasn't sure that i believed that but i knew i was an ass,P,Insignificant
and and uh,P,Insignificant
but i probably believed it and not in its totality but in part <snort>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
<sigh> uh i'm very uh i'm not judgemental uh uh i would listen to anybody,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
whether i agree with you or disagree with you,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
uh i've taught myself to uh,P,Insignificant
control anger that i that i have uh,P,Insignificant
and uh if if i've called you my friend or if i tell you i love you uh i mean it it's that's not something that i do uh,P,Insignificant
casually,P,Insignificant
