"A little bit. I’ve been trying to stick to a budget and keep track of my spending, but it’s still overwhelming sometimes.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a positive step. How do you feel when you stick to your budget?,T,Insignificant
"It feels good, but then I worry about unexpected expenses popping up.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. It’s hard to feel secure when there are so many variables. Have you had any unexpected expenses since we last spoke?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yes, I had to buy a new couch because the old one was falling apart. It was more expensive than I planned.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

It’s interesting how horror can evoke such strong emotions. Do you think it helps you process your own feelings in any way?,T,Insignificant
"I think so. It distracts me from my worries, and sometimes I think about the characters and their struggles, which makes me reflect on my own life.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valuable insight. Reflecting on characters can sometimes help us gain perspective on our own experiences. Have you had any moments of reflection that stood out to you?,T,Insignificant
"I was thinking about the characters’ fears and how they dealt with them. It reminded me of how I’ve been trying to face my own fears, like the anxiety around money.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a powerful connection. Facing fears can be daunting, but it sounds like you’re making progress. What are some specific fears you’re working on?",T,Insignificant
I guess the fear of not being able to provide for myself or my kids. It’s always in the back of my mind.,P,Risk Assessment

"I’ve looked at a few job boards, but I haven’t applied to anything yet. I guess I’m just hesitant.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s normal to feel hesitant, especially with the added stress. What do you think is holding you back from applying?",T,Insignificant
"I think it’s the fear of rejection and not being good enough. I haven’t worked for a while, and I worry I won’t measure up.",P,Risk Assessment
Those feelings are valid. It can be hard to put ourselves out there. What if we explored some affirmations or self-compassion techniques to help combat those thoughts?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That could be helpful. I often find myself being too critical of myself.,P,Insignificant
"Let’s start with an affirmation. How about something like, “I am capable and deserving of opportunities”? Would you be willing to try repeating that?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I can try that. I like the idea of reminding myself that I’m capable.",P,Insignificant
"Great! We can also work on a self-compassion exercise. Whenever you notice those critical thoughts, try to acknowledge them and respond with kindness, as if you were speaking to a friend.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I like that idea. I’m often harder on myself than I would be on others.,P,Insignificant
