an experience,P,Insignificant
pure peaceful,P,Insignificant
about sedona,P,Insignificant

energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat,P,Insignificant

uh pine trees,P,Insignificant

and after a day the pain in my back went away,P,Physiological Observations
that i had there for months,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

in life <laughter>,P,Insignificant
or in sedona in life,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well being on stage in boston,P,Insignificant

um just being with friends and laughing,P,Insignificant

well um,P,Insignificant
i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and,P,Insignificant
just laugh and,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but,P,Insignificant
just being with somebody who's in tune with,P,Insignificant
my sense of humor and uh gets,P,Insignificant

you know i get his and we're,P,Insignificant
just um enjoying that moment,P,Insignificant

musical comedy when i was a child i would,P,Insignificant
sing along to records in my living room,P,Insignificant
and i was always in choirs,P,Insignificant
in school and then when i,P,Insignificant
uh went to high school i joined the drama club,P,Insignificant
and i i just always had an interest and i always had a,P,Insignificant
a big personality and,P,Insignificant
well <laughter>,P,Insignificant
um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm sixty and,P,Insignificant
i don't know if i,P,Insignificant
have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
relax and travel but um,P,Insignificant
i i like being creative,P,Insignificant
in in any way i can i like independence,P,Insignificant
and i kind of have that right now so,P,Insignificant
i'm okay,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded,P,Insignificant
and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um gosh since nineteen eighty eight,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and um i'm,P,Insignificant
a district leader in my community,P,Insignificant
and we have meetings and that really helps to,P,Insignificant
center me and bring out my higher self,P,Insignificant
so if i get tense or nervous i i chant,P,Insignificant
um sometimes okay sometimes not,P,Insignificant
a lot yes yes <laughter>,P,Insignificant
less and less though it's been happening less and less,P,Insignificant
but um,P,Insignificant
yeah sometimes it's got it's,P,Insignificant
it's um,P,Insignificant
created difficulties,P,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
i can't <c> <sigh>,P,Insignificant
i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like,P,Insignificant
was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving,P,Insignificant
and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway,P,Insignificant
about four miles out of our way and i just,P,Insignificant
i got very angry for about,P,Insignificant
thirty seconds and then i had to,P,Insignificant
calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it,P,Insignificant
so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but,P,Insignificant
i felt kind of,P,Insignificant
bad that i overreacted,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you mean in my life <laughter>,P,Insignificant
manys,P,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
gosh there's so many <laughter>,P,Insignificant
i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing,P,Insignificant
information,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
they're not gonna use me on a job or something,P,Insignificant
that i would,P,Insignificant
take an attitude that,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'll find something better it's okay and,P,Insignificant
move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and,P,Insignificant
you know that,P,Insignificant
whole uh,P,Insignificant
thought process that really doesn't help the situation,P,Insignificant
and i do that more often,P,Insignificant
but i,P,Insignificant
since i started chanting,P,Insignificant
but it doesn't you know,P,Insignificant
i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where,P,Insignificant
i can do that,P,Insignificant
um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what,P,Insignificant
television to buy or something <laughter> but um,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
or leaving my  comfort,P,Insignificant
zone <z> place,P,Insignificant
if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place,P,Insignificant
that would be a very difficult decision for me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and probably leaving a relationship,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
very hard because,P,Insignificant
you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so i usually,P,Insignificant
live it out til,P,Insignificant
it's for you know it's,P,Insignificant
they leave or something you know it's very hard for me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so what i usually do is i don't make the decision,P,Insignificant
and i end up suffering,P,Insignificant
but longer,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
can we move on,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
uh it's hard,P,Insignificant
because um i don't know if it's because i have pain,P,Insignificant
in my back,P,Physiological Observations
and neck,P,Physiological Observations
but,P,Insignificant
i i it's difficult for me to,P,Insignificant
stay asleep i'd i i,P,Physiological Observations
i don't get a um,P,Physiological Observations
a deep sleep,P,Physiological Observations
um,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
at because of,P,Insignificant
uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil,P,Physiological Observations
and that's been putting me to sleep so,P,Physiological Observations
i have been um,P,Physiological Observations
sleeping better because of it,P,Physiological Observations
but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell,P,Insignificant
but before that all happened,P,Insignificant
i was um,P,Insignificant
finding it difficult to stay asleep,P,Physiological Observations
and so therefore i'm tired during the day and,P,Physiological Observations
uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable,P,Physiological Observations
but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or,P,Insignificant
emotional things or or or or not,P,Insignificant
i'm sorry could you repeat that,P,Insignificant
have i studied changes in my behavior,P,Insignificant
uh no <laughter>,P,Insignificant
i was not,P,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
mm mm,P,Insignificant
oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know,P,Insignificant
well i uh,P,Insignificant
was going to um,P,Insignificant
vegas to,P,Insignificant
meet my family was my,P,Insignificant
my family was flying in from cleveland to,P,Insignificant
uh there we have a,P,Insignificant
a relative in uh vegas,P,Insignificant
and i drove with my friend,P,Insignificant
and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
we all went and,P,Insignificant
had a good time in vegas,P,Insignificant
i mean i was struggling through my cold but,P,Insignificant
but it was fun it was nice,P,Insignificant
well <laughter>,P,Insignificant
uh they think i'm funny um,P,Insignificant
they feel that i say it like it is,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so,P,Insignificant
people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me,P,Insignificant
'cause i'll,P,Insignificant
i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic,P,Insignificant
but just <ju> that's just the way i talk,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
um my um,P,Insignificant
the,P,Insignificant
anger that sometimes wells up in me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know i just,P,Insignificant
but although that that really made me i think,P,Insignificant
a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your,P,Insignificant
experiences make you who you are,P,Insignificant
and how you handle them,P,Insignificant
makes you who you are and if you don't have those,P,Insignificant
lows you don't really know what highs are,P,Insignificant
so i don't,P,Insignificant
i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever,P,Insignificant
but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today,P,Insignificant
and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these,P,Insignificant
moments where i've,P,Insignificant
just blurt out you know anger or something,P,Insignificant
i just wish that would happen more less,P,Insignificant
that the anger parts would happen less,P,Insignificant
and they are so,P,Insignificant
i guess it will <laughter>,P,Insignificant
happen less,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
don't give up hope live in the moment,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
everything will everything will work out everything will work out,P,Insignificant
and if you believe that,P,Insignificant
then you really have nothing to fear,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
the fact that now,P,Insignificant
and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been,P,Insignificant
cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become,P,Insignificant
more um,P,Insignificant
compassionate person,P,Insignificant
and i'm able to um,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
<ss> understand people better,P,Insignificant
and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
that,P,Insignificant
if you if you treat people,P,Insignificant
from that respect that they're,P,Insignificant
they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because,P,Insignificant
you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally,P,Insignificant
and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate,P,Insignificant
you're you're happy and your life is happy,P,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
