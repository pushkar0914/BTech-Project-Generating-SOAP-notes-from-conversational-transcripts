yes,P,Psychosocial History
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked,P,Psychosocial History
all the different,P,Insignificant
ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy,P,Psychosocial History
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
huh,P,Insignificant
i don't know but i really like children and i really like,P,Psychosocial History
studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i,P,Psychosocial History
i think i'm pretty friendly,P,Psychosocial History
uh huh,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read,P,Current Functional Status
um,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about,P,Current Functional Status
other things if i start getting mad or um,P,Current Functional Status
i just start trying to focus on my breathing,P,Current Functional Status
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend,P,Psychosocial History
um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um,P,Insignificant
i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party,P,Psychosocial History
and he was getting frustrated,P,Psychosocial History
which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and,P,Psychosocial History
i,P,Insignificant
really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out,P,Psychosocial History
i see,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
i think a lot of times when my,P,Insignificant
oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother,P,Insignificant
uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close,P,Psychosocial History
as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i,P,Insignificant
and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
when i was nineteen,P,Psychosocial History
i came home,P,Insignificant
from a party,P,Insignificant
i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things,P,Psychosocial History
and then he didn't speak to me for about a year,P,Psychosocial History
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home,P,Psychosocial History
um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could,P,Psychosocial History
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
and i love my siblings i,P,Insignificant
again my little sister and i get along really well she's,P,Psychosocial History
four years younger than me,P,Insignificant
and when,P,Insignificant
when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and,P,Psychosocial History
i wasn't,P,Insignificant
in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore,P,Psychosocial History
and that's really great,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
we get along okay with my uh,P,Insignificant
my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve,P,Psychosocial History
that's good,T,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good,P,Psychosocial History
uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and,P,Insignificant
who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but,P,Physiological Observations
generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning,P,Physiological Observations
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i'm really tired i can get grumpy,P,Physiological Observations
but i think usually i'm just,P,Insignificant
groggy,P,Physiological Observations
okay,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
pretty good i'm a little anxious about,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
<sigh> well,P,Insignificant
i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic,P,Current Functional Status
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
well i think the last time i felt really happy i,P,Insignificant
went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people,P,Psychosocial History
and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
um she would probably say that,P,Insignificant
i'm smart and uh,P,Insignificant
pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch,P,Psychosocial History
really like serious films and t_v,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot,P,Psychosocial History
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so,P,Psychosocial History
um so that's a major one that and procrastinating,P,Psychosocial History
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh,P,Psychosocial History
uh given,P,Insignificant
eh,P,Insignificant
sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was,P,Psychosocial History
very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem,P,Insignificant
like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock,P,Insignificant
speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job,P,Insignificant
but it was,P,Insignificant
was not,P,Insignificant
great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that sucks,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
well i would've been twelve,P,Insignificant
and two,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
but i think,P,Insignificant
i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think,P,Psychosocial History
i was a little selfish and self-involved back then,P,Psychosocial History
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
i do regret,P,Insignificant
a couple of,P,Insignificant
semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a,P,Psychosocial History
a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript,P,Psychosocial History
could you have done anything to avoid it,T,Insignificant
i think so i'm,P,Insignificant
i think i,P,Insignificant
i wasn't focusing in school at that time,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely could've done that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend,T,Insignificant
hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then,P,Psychosocial History
going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges,P,Psychosocial History
and then maybe,P,Insignificant
going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
and maybe watching a little bit of t_v,P,Psychosocial History
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
huh,P,Insignificant
well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up,P,Psychosocial History
i'm ten years older than him so,P,Insignificant
and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which,P,Psychosocial History
made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and,P,Psychosocial History
um and how close we are,P,Psychosocial History
