"Hi, welcome back! How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"I've been okay, a bit anxious, but I'm managing.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s good to hear you’re managing. Last time, you mentioned feeling anxious and having dreams that felt very real. Have those dreams continued?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yes, they have. I had another one last night about fighting again. It’s like I can’t escape it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds really challenging. Can you tell me more about what happened in that dream?,T,Insignificant
"I was in the ring, and I was supposed to be coaching someone, but then I ended up fighting myself. It felt so intense, like I was really there.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like a very vivid experience. How did you feel when you woke up from that?,T,Insignificant
"I felt exhausted, like I had actually fought. And there was this nagging feeling of failure because I didn't finish the fight.",P,Physiological Observations: History of Present Illness (HPI)
Those feelings of exhaustion and failure can be really tough to deal with. Have you noticed any patterns in your waking life that might be contributing to these dreams?,T,Insignificant
I think stress from work and trying to balance everything is affecting me. I feel like I’m always in fight-or-flight mode.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of tension. Have you tried any techniques to help manage that stress?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been painting more, which helps a little. But when I’m busy, I forget to take those breaks.",P,Current Functional Status
Painting sounds like a wonderful outlet. How does it feel when you’re immersed in that process?,T,Insignificant
"It feels freeing. I get lost in the colors and the strokes, and it takes my mind off everything else.",P,Current Functional Status
That’s great to hear. Maybe we can look at incorporating more scheduled painting time into your week to help you unwind. How does that sound?,T,Next Steps
I like that idea! I need to prioritize it more.,P,Next Steps
Wonderful! You mentioned feeling anxious lately. Can you describe what those anxious moments feel like for you?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s like my heart races, and I can't focus. Sometimes I feel like I’m on edge, waiting for something bad to happen.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That sounds really uncomfortable. When you feel that way, what do you usually do to cope?",T,Insignificant
I try to breathe deeply or go for a walk. But sometimes it just lingers.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Walking and deep breathing are excellent strategies. Have you ever tried grounding techniques to help when anxiety strikes?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve heard of them, but I haven’t really practiced them.",P,Insignificant
Grounding techniques can be very helpful. They focus on bringing you back to the present moment. Would you like to try one together now?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, I’m open to it.",P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s try a simple one. Look around the room and name five things you can see.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Okay, um... the chair, the window, the plant, the lamp, and the clock.",P,Insignificant
"Excellent! Now, let’s move to four things you can touch.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"The chair, my hands, the fabric of my shirt, and the table.",P,Insignificant
Perfect! Now three things you can hear.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"The clock ticking, my breathing, and... is that a car outside?",P,Insignificant
"Yes, it is! And now, two things you can smell.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I can smell the fresh paint from the art supplies I brought and... I think some coffee from the break room.,P,Insignificant
"Great job! And finally, one thing you can taste.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Just the remnants of my breakfast, I guess. ",P,Insignificant
How do you feel after doing that exercise?,T,Insignificant
A little more centered. It helps to focus on the present instead of getting lost in my thoughts.,P,Current Functional Status
I’m glad to hear that. Grounding exercises can be a great tool to use when anxiety arises. Do you think you could practice this technique at home?,T,Next Steps
"Yes, I think I can give it a try.",P,Next Steps

"I’ve been trying to limit my screen time before bed, but it’s hard.",P,Current Functional Status
"That’s a great step. Sometimes, creating a calming bedtime routine can also help. Have you thought about what you might include in that routine?",T,Insignificant
Maybe some light reading or listening to soft music?,P,Next Steps
Those sound like wonderful ideas. How about we set a goal for you to try that for a week and see how it affects your sleep?,T,Next Steps
I can do that. I’ll try to read a little before bed.,P,Next Steps
Perfect! We’ll check in on that next session. Is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss today?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been thinking about my family a lot. It’s hard to connect with them.,P,Psychosocial History
Family dynamics can be complicated. What specifically has been on your mind?,T,Insignificant
I feel like I’m missing out on a lot because we’re all so scattered. It makes me sad.,P,Psychosocial History
"It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you thought about ways to reconnect with them, even from a distance?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve thought about organizing a family call or something, but I’m not sure how to approach it.",P,Psychosocial History
That sounds like a great idea! Maybe you could start by reaching out to one family member to gauge interest. Would you like to set that as a goal for this week?,T,Next Steps
"Yes, I think I’ll try that.",P,Next Steps
Wonderful! I’m proud of you for wanting to reconnect. It can be really rewarding. ,T,Insignificant
