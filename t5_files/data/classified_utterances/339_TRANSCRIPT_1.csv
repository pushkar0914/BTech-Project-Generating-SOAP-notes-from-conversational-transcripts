"Hi, Ellie. I’ve been okay, I guess. A bit up and down.",P,Insignificant
I understand. Can you tell me more about what’s been making you feel that way?,T,Insignificant

Overthinking can be exhausting. What thoughts tend to come up for you during those times?,T,Insignificant

Those feelings of pressure can be tough. It seems like you have high expectations for yourself. How do you feel about those expectations?,T,Insignificant

"Sure, let’s do it.",P,Insignificant
"Alright, let’s take a deep breath in… 1, 2, 3, 4… and out… 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel for you?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
