<laughter>,P,Insignificant

what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
being able to experience a different way of living,P,Psychosocial History
um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and,P,Psychosocial History
getting a different perspective,P,Psychosocial History
uh huh,T,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months,P,Psychosocial History
and i was in bahia which is in the north and um,P,Psychosocial History
let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family,P,Psychosocial History
nice,T,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um,P,Psychosocial History
they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i think taking a bus by myself to,P,Psychosocial History
a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant

<laughter>,P,Insignificant
dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how to um,P,Insignificant
how to intervene effectively with different cultures,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant
basically that those would be the main characteristics,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
i think that's a false dichotomy,P,Insignificant
but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone,P,Mental Health Observations
and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful,P,Mental Health Observations
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
um i listen to music,P,Mental Health Observations
and just lay on my bed and,P,Mental Health Observations
um,P,Insignificant
i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things,P,Mental Health Observations
mhm,T,Insignificant
also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise,P,Mental Health Observations
cool,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
pretty good i don't get angry a lot,P,Mental Health Observations
um,P,Insignificant
so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that,P,Mental Health Observations
that's good,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
mm what month is this may,P,Insignificant
probably two months ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i argued,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
with a friend i've had for a few years,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
hmm,T,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
i felt anxious,P,Risk Assessment
um,P,Insignificant
sad and angry,P,Risk Assessment
um,P,Insignificant
yeah those are the main emotions,P,Risk Assessment
okay,T,Insignificant
how do you know them,T,Insignificant
i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them,P,Mental Health Observations
and then i'll notice the physical,P,Mental Health Observations
uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty,P,Mental Health Observations
if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me,P,Mental Health Observations
mhm,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
hmm <laughter>,P,Insignificant
that i wish i had handled differently,P,Insignificant
i guess related to this argument um,P,Insignificant
i went out one night and got,P,Insignificant
a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up,P,Insignificant
calling a person for a ride,P,Insignificant
home but that,P,Insignificant
really upset that person,P,Insignificant
and i know that,P,Insignificant
it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
hardest decision <sigh>,P,Insignificant
wow um,P,Insignificant
probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards,P,Psychosocial History
well after dropping out i had to really,P,Insignificant
rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to,P,Insignificant
dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
i think by recognizing what i don't want to do,P,Insignificant
and doing a lot of research on,P,Insignificant
program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program,P,Psychosocial History
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
<sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh>,P,Insignificant
oh <laughter>,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier,P,Insignificant
it was a dating relationship and,P,Insignificant
a few years ago we had a falling out,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
over his treatment of me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and it involved,P,Insignificant
another person and i wish i could,P,Insignificant
get that out of my mind,P,Insignificant
i'm sorry to hear that,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
um <laughter>,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten,P,Psychosocial History
um closer to her as an adult,P,Psychosocial History
uh we talk pretty regularly,P,Psychosocial History
with my dad i grew up with him,P,Psychosocial History
mostly he lives in atlanta and,P,Psychosocial History
um we don't talk as much but,P,Psychosocial History
we are,P,Insignificant
we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that,P,Psychosocial History
contentious or anything,P,Psychosocial History
and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family,P,Psychosocial History
uh huh,T,Insignificant
um so,P,Insignificant
in general i'm not really that close to family,P,Psychosocial History
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five,P,Psychosocial History
and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really,P,Psychosocial History
opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
<sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up,P,Physiological Observations
why,T,Insignificant
because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day,P,Physiological Observations
and the thought of it is,P,Insignificant
you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired,P,Physiological Observations
not really feeling refreshed,P,Physiological Observations
i understand,T,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
i think just <sigh>,P,Insignificant
self-talk about how what i have to do,P,Insignificant
isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year,P,Mental Health Observations
um,P,Insignificant
trying to think of things that,P,Insignificant
i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music,P,Mental Health Observations
and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going,P,Mental Health Observations
mhm,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
<sigh> feeling <sigh>,P,Insignificant
uh wow um,P,Insignificant
feeling,P,Insignificant
emotionally drained on some ways and,P,Risk Assessment
at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown,P,Risk Assessment
so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of,P,Risk Assessment
feeling accomplished and proud at the same time,P,Risk Assessment
uh huh,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no i haven't,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how long ago were you diagnosed,T,Insignificant
in two thousand six,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and just all those changes going on,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
really um,P,Insignificant
exacerbated ,P,Insignificant
things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

yes,P,Insignificant
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy,T,Insignificant
i notice,P,Insignificant
i'm better able to,P,Mental Health Observations
accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them,P,Mental Health Observations
i'm <sigh>,P,Insignificant
able to think <th>,P,Insignificant
think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light,P,Mental Health Observations
and also identify,P,Insignificant
the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas,P,Mental Health Observations
