short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned,P,Mental Health Observations
there's not there's not much to that,P,Mental Health Observations
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um,P,Insignificant
being very difficult to work with um,P,Insignificant
and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh,P,Insignificant
they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because,P,Insignificant
um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sucks,T,Insignificant
it does <laughter>,P,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um,P,Insignificant
it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and,P,Insignificant
yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point,P,Insignificant
or it would it would kill him you know,P,Insignificant
um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i,P,Insignificant
i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
it is,P,Insignificant
it was,P,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated,P,Psychosocial History
and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together,P,Psychosocial History
and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so,P,Psychosocial History
she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old,P,Psychosocial History
wow,T,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
and so she needs to,P,Insignificant
uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh,P,Insignificant
someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage,P,Insignificant
um as far as um,P,Insignificant
the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife,P,Insignificant
can you give me an example of that,T,Insignificant
uh yeah i um,P,Insignificant
got caught up in a situation where,P,Insignificant
um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart,P,Insignificant
and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so,P,Insignificant
you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money,P,Insignificant
and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship,P,Insignificant
had to do with trust because um,P,Insignificant
it it was devastating to my wife,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light,P,Insignificant
um i felt very guilty,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant

after i had my heart attack a few years ago,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that,P,Mental Health Observations
that's great,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
the last time i felt really happy,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
probably when,P,Insignificant
i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and um,P,Insignificant
he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that,P,Insignificant
he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
well i guess number one thing is uh,P,Insignificant
my physical being itself,P,Insignificant
i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
just in general just be more healthier physically,P,Insignificant
and as far as mentally um just not,P,Insignificant
go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
just one day at a time,P,Insignificant
you know i just uh,P,Insignificant
try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis,P,Mental Health Observations
i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself,P,Insignificant
i do things to help myself,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage,P,Insignificant
uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and,P,Insignificant
and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done,P,Insignificant
so i don't focus too much on the past,P,Insignificant
i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing,P,Insignificant
to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed,P,Insignificant
um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh,P,Insignificant
i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
probably,P,Insignificant
the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that,P,Insignificant
um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that,P,Insignificant
um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive,P,Insignificant
uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy,P,Insignificant
and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh,P,Insignificant
just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night,P,Insignificant
one day at a time,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where,P,Insignificant
you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines,P,Insignificant
and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
