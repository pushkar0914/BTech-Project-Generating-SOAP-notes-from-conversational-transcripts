<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
well i started out in business,P,Medical and Psychiatric History

and so i decided to study what i wanted to study,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
while i was in college,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and had the opportunity,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so that's what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um but i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and being a professor of ethics,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how i,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
ended up joining the peace corps <laughter> so it all worked out,P,Medical and Psychiatric History

um i have a actual fish tank,P,Insignificant
um at my house and i i do the the same thing and i do that with my children when they get upset um the i sit them in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing,P,Current Functional Status
um i also try and meditate,P,Current Functional Status
um i try and and just sit down and be quiet,P,Current Functional Status
um and gather my thoughts,P,Current Functional Status
um i like to read,P,Current Functional Status
and um or sometimes i i walk or i'll take my dog for a walk,P,Current Functional Status
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
<sigh> i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
every once in a while,P,Insignificant
um when things are getting too chaotic,P,Insignificant
at my house um,P,Insignificant
and i'm feeling very underappreciated,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i will,P,Insignificant
have a,P,Insignificant
burst of anger,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of,P,Insignificant
um recognizing that i'm upset about it,P,Insignificant
my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad,P,Insignificant
and then that escalates and,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
sometimes i just end up walking out the door,P,Insignificant
or going to my room,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
i'm sorry,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
um i i usually after i have an outburst,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i isolate myself for a little bit,P,Current Functional Status
i can come back relaxed,P,Current Functional Status
and deal with the situation,P,Current Functional Status
in a,P,Insignificant
more,P,Insignificant
calm manner,P,Current Functional Status
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to,P,Current Functional Status
stop and and get myself out of there,P,Current Functional Status
and and go take some deep breaths,P,Current Functional Status
um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling,P,Current Functional Status
mhm,T,Insignificant
why i'm being angry why why am i being,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
so tense,P,Insignificant
and then be able to verbalize that,P,Current Functional Status
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i i it happens a few times when i start getting,P,Insignificant
i've had a very tense day,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um and things haven't gone right,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework,P,Insignificant
or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh,P,Insignificant
uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then,P,Insignificant
and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
just let me finish dinner,P,Insignificant
and nobody would,P,Insignificant
and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up,P,Insignificant
and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to,P,Insignificant
pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
um so that that i i should have um,P,Insignificant
walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that,P,Current Functional Status
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um i wasn't married,P,Insignificant
um <tisk> i had a very good friend,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
oh i was i was,P,Insignificant
thirty two at the time,P,Insignificant
so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
and i had,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
but we'd only been dating like three months,P,Insignificant
and i was living with,P,Insignificant
a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with,P,Insignificant
um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well,P,Insignificant
um i didn't know if we could raise a child together,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together,P,Insignificant
um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together,P,Insignificant
aw,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and uh so it was a lot of,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
huge decisions,P,Insignificant
that were gonna determine the rest of my life,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and i,P,Insignificant
made the decision based on,P,Insignificant
more common sense and practicality,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
but i don't regret that decision,P,Insignificant
i think i made a good decision,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
to marry my husband and,P,Insignificant
raise our child <laughter>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about your kids,T,Insignificant
um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen,P,Psychosocial History
he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering,P,Psychosocial History
he is getting his pilot's license,P,Psychosocial History
uh which i'm very proud of him for,P,Psychosocial History
um then my daughter is,P,Psychosocial History
fifteen,P,Psychosocial History
and she loves acting,P,Psychosocial History
uh she um she has a boyfriend,P,Psychosocial History
who um,P,Psychosocial History
uh they see just once a week at church basically,P,Psychosocial History
um and they text each other constantly,P,Psychosocial History
um she's a very very typical fifteen year old,P,Psychosocial History
(laughter,T,Insignificant
and then i have a twelve year old,P,Psychosocial History
he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly,P,Psychosocial History
um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house,P,Psychosocial History
so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis,P,Psychosocial History
nice,T,Insignificant
do you find it easy to be a parent,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young,P,Trauma History
and um my mother kind of disconnected,P,Trauma History
when that happened,P,Trauma History
um so i didn't have a very warm or loving,P,Trauma History
relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was,P,Trauma History
um kind of on my own from a very young age,P,Trauma History
um,P,Insignificant
i mean she was at the house but,P,Insignificant
really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have,P,Insignificant
parenting skills,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
that you know most people are are raised with,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i know what not to do,P,Insignificant
but sometimes it's very difficult and um,P,Insignificant
i i see my friends that have you know these,P,Insignificant
very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect,P,Insignificant
um and it's like i i'm just not that person,P,Insignificant
so i i,P,Insignificant
i try and be,P,Insignificant
i'm i i think i am a very good mother,P,Insignificant
but i'm not um,P,Insignificant
a typical mother,P,Insignificant
i think i'm more,P,Insignificant
um i'm more creative,P,Insignificant
a lot of times i and we do a lot of things,P,Insignificant
um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
actually when we go camping it's more,P,Insignificant
i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home,P,Insignificant
i think i'm more tense when i'm at home,P,Insignificant
but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become,P,Current Functional Status
calmer and more patient,P,Current Functional Status
i think my patience is what,P,Insignificant
um i need to work on the most,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
i'm a been an insomniac all my life,P,Physiological Observations
i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and,P,Insignificant
um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise,P,Physiological Observations
and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day,P,Physiological Observations
i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired,P,Physiological Observations
to sleep well,P,Physiological Observations
um and that's sometimes that's hard to do,P,Insignificant
um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading,P,Physiological Observations
i'll read 'til midnight,P,Physiological Observations
um and then i'll try and go to sleep,P,Physiological Observations
um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again,P,Physiological Observations
and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep,P,Physiological Observations
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
yesterday i didn't feel so good i was,P,Physiological Observations
um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday,P,Physiological Observations
um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard,P,Current Functional Status
um so i had some more planting to do,P,Current Functional Status
and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it,P,Insignificant
um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good,P,Physiological Observations
so i feel more positive i feel more energy,P,Physiological Observations
that's good,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that,P,Insignificant
hasn't really helped me sleep,P,Physiological Observations
but um,P,Insignificant
it was really good because i needed one for a really long time,P,Insignificant
and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane,P,Insignificant
um but it was,P,Insignificant
you know just like,P,Insignificant
i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's,P,Insignificant
it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing,P,Insignificant
and it was like finally,P,Insignificant
uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list,P,Insignificant
um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and,P,Insignificant
uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
<laughter> i don't know um,P,Insignificant
i think she,P,Insignificant
believes that i'm,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am,P,Insignificant
at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice,P,Insignificant
um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me,P,Insignificant
um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by,P,Insignificant
uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
um or empathetic and,P,Insignificant
uh i just i'm just there to listen,P,Insignificant
and i don't need to give her any advice so,P,Insignificant
i think a a good listener and,P,Insignificant
good advice giver,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
i procrastinate a lot,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um i start projects and i don't finish them,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
almost finished,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and then,P,Insignificant
i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant
sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
which sounds a little strange but,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i i'm working on that,P,Insignificant
i'm trying to get those done,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
oh gosh <laughter> um,P,Insignificant
not following through on the opportunities i had when,P,Insignificant
i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant
with on a grant and things of that sort um,P,Insignificant
but instead i got pregnant and got married,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
where i had to fight for a directorship,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and so i really wish so i resigned,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant
and i wish i had stuck with that,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant
'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
solid career,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yeah,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
not,P,Insignificant
base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um the jobs were wonderful,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
my ego got in the way,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the,P,Insignificant
the,P,Insignificant
egotistical,P,Insignificant
reactions that i had,P,Insignificant
to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
um my children actually,P,Psychosocial History
um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal,P,Psychosocial History
um and,P,Insignificant
uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that,P,Insignificant
they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl,P,Insignificant
my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started,P,Psychosocial History
and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day,P,Psychosocial History
and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it,P,Insignificant
um so that's,P,Insignificant
that was,P,Insignificant
one of my prouder,P,Insignificant
experiences,P,Insignificant
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
bye,P,Insignificant
