"Hi Ellie! I've been okay, I guess. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster, but I'm hanging in there.",P,Insignificant
I'm glad to hear you're hanging in there. What has been the most significant thing on your mind lately?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I've been thinking a lot about my son and the custody situation. It's just so stressful.",P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
That sounds really tough. Have you had any updates on the custody case since we last spoke?,T,Insignificant
"Not really. Just the same tension with my family. They keep pushing their views on me, and I feel overwhelmed.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from your family. How are you coping with that pressure?,T,Insignificant
"I try to remind myself that I know what's best for my son, but it's hard when everyone else is so vocal about their opinions.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That's understandable. It’s important to trust your instincts as a parent. Have you found any specific strategies that help you manage that pressure?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to journal more about my feelings, but sometimes I just end up crying instead.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Journaling can be a powerful tool, even if it leads to tears. What do you usually write about when you're journaling?",T,Insignificant
"Mostly about my worries, like how I’m going to prove I’m a good mom. I write about my hopes for my son too.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a great approach. It can help clarify your thoughts and feelings. Have you noticed any patterns in what you write about?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I tend to focus on the negative things, like my fears about losing him. I don’t write enough about the positive moments.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Recognizing that pattern is a good first step. How might you incorporate more positive reflections into your journaling?,T,Insignificant
"Maybe I could start each entry with something good that happened that day, no matter how small.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds like a wonderful idea! Focusing on the positives can help shift your mindset. How do you feel about trying that in your next journal entry?,T,Insignificant
I feel good about it! I think it could help me see things differently.,P,Insignificant
Great! Let's check in on your mood. How have you been feeling overall in the past week?,T,Insignificant
"Honestly, I've had some ups and downs. Some days I feel okay, but others I just feel really down like I can't get out of bed.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're experiencing some fluctuations in your mood. Have you noticed any triggers for those down days?,T,Insignificant
I think it’s mostly when I think about my son. The missing him just hits me hard sometimes.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. It’s natural to feel that way. Have you considered any coping strategies for those particularly tough days?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried to distract myself by watching shows or reading, but sometimes it just doesn’t work.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
