Hi there! It’s great to see you again. How have things been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
Pretty good! I did some research on social work and looked into some programs.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s fantastic! What did you find?  ,T,Insignificant
There are a few local programs that sound interesting. Some even offer online classes.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s a great start. How do you feel about the options you found?  ,T,Insignificant
I’m excited but also a bit overwhelmed by the idea of going back to school.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s completely normal to feel that way. What specifically feels overwhelming?  ,T,Insignificant
"Just the thought of balancing everything—work, kids, and school.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valid concern. Maybe we can brainstorm ways to create a manageable schedule?  ,T,Insignificant
"That would help, yeah.  ",P,Insignificant
Let’s break it down. How many hours a week do you think you could realistically dedicate to classes?  ,T,Insignificant
I could probably do one or two evenings a week.  ,P,Current Functional Status
That sounds doable. What about your kids? How could they fit into this plan?  ,T,Insignificant
I could ask my girlfriend to help out on those nights.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s a great idea! It’s important to have support. Have you talked to her about this?  ,T,Insignificant
"Not yet, but I think she’d be on board.  ",P,Psychosocial History
It might be a good conversation to have soon. How do you think she would feel about you pursuing this?  ,T,Insignificant
I think she’d be really supportive.  ,P,Psychosocial History

"I’ve been trying to spend more quality time with my kids, and it’s been nice.  ",P,Psychosocial History
That’s great progress! What activities have you been doing together?  ,T,Insignificant
"We started reading together every night, and they love it.  ",P,Psychosocial History
That sounds lovely! How does it feel to be more present with them?  ,T,Insignificant
It feels really rewarding. I feel closer to them.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s beautiful. Have you noticed any changes in their behavior since you started being more engaged?  ,T,Insignificant
They seem happier and more open with me.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s a positive outcome. It’s amazing what a little extra time can do. Are there any challenges you’ve encountered while trying to be more present?  ,T,Insignificant
Sometimes I still get stressed and need to remind myself to focus.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Remember to use the mindfulness techniques we practiced. It’s a skill that takes time to develop.  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I’ll keep trying.  ,P,Insignificant
And don’t hesitate to take breaks when you need them. It’s important to recharge.  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I appreciate that.  ,P,Insignificant
Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve been feeling a bit anxious again about job hunting.  ,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
Let’s talk about that. Have you applied to any new jobs since we last spoke?  ,T,Insignificant
I applied to a couple but haven’t heard back yet.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That can be tough. How are you coping with the waiting?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to keep busy, but it’s hard not to think about it.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s natural to feel that way. Maybe setting aside specific times to look for jobs could help.  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds like a good idea.  ,P,Insignificant
"You could also celebrate small victories, like submitting an application, regardless of the outcome.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I like that approach.  ,P,Insignificant
"Let’s set that as a goal for the week—dedicate some time to job searching, and celebrate your efforts!  ",T,Next Steps
I can do that.  ,P,Insignificant
