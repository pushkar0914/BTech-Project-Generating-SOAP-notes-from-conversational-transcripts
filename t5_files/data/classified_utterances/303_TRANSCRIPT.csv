mhm,T,Insignificant
can you give me an example of that,T,Insignificant
well um,P,Insignificant
by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature,P,Psychosocial History
mhm ,T,Insignificant

yeah,T,Insignificant
they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can,P,Psychosocial History
yeah i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences ,T,Insignificant
with my kids or just period,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Insignificant
what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know,P,Psychosocial History
wow,T,Insignificant
and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know,P,Psychosocial History
you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me ,P,Psychosocial History
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment ,T,Insignificant
happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sounds like a great situation ,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
hm,P,Insignificant
well the advice i would've gave myself,P,Insignificant
that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that,P,Insignificant
i probably would've,P,Insignificant
stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
right,T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
could you have done anything to avoid it,T,Insignificant
i'm not quite sure um,P,Insignificant
you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

mhm,T,Insignificant
