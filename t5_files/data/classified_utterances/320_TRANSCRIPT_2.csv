Hi! Welcome back. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying out the journaling, and it’s been helpful.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s wonderful to hear! What have you been writing about?  ,T,Insignificant
Mostly about my nightmares and how I felt after them.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a great way to process those emotions. Have you noticed any patterns in your writing?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I noticed that I often write about feeling trapped or scared.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s an important observation. It reflects how your trauma is affecting your emotions. How do you feel after writing those entries?  ,T,Insignificant
It feels like I’m releasing some of the pressure.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a positive step. Have you found any particular writing prompts that resonate with you?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve been writing about my feelings during the day and how they relate to my nightmares.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great approach. It can help connect the dots between your daily experiences and your dreams.  ,T,Insignificant
I think it’s helping me understand myself better.  ,P,Progress Evaluation
I’m glad to hear that! Have you had any nightmares since we last spoke?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes, but I felt a bit more prepared for them.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s progress! How did you cope when you woke up from the nightmares this time?  ,T,Insignificant
"I used my breathing exercises right away, and it helped me calm down.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Fantastic! It’s great to see you applying what we’ve talked about. How about your relationship with your son? Have you had a chance to share anything with him?  ,T,Insignificant
"I did! I told him I’ve been feeling a bit off lately, and he was really understanding.  ",P,Current Functional Status
That’s wonderful! How did that conversation feel for you?  ,T,Insignificant
"It felt good. I was nervous at first, but I’m glad I did it.  ",P,Current Functional Status
That’s a huge step forward. It’s important to communicate your feelings. Are there any other areas in your life where you’d like to improve communication?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I need to reach out to my family more. I’ve been isolating myself.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a common reaction, especially after trauma. What do you think is holding you back from reaching out?  ",T,Insignificant
I guess I’m just afraid they won’t understand.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valid concern. Would it help to start with a text or a call instead of a face-to-face conversation?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I could do that.  ",P,Next Steps
Great! It might feel less intimidating. What would you want to share with them?  ,T,Insignificant
Just that I’m trying to work through some things and could use their support.  ,P,Current Functional Status
"That sounds like a good approach. Remember, it’s okay to set boundaries around what you share.  ",T,Insignificant
I’ll keep that in mind.  ,P,Insignificant
Is there anything else you’d like to explore today?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’m still struggling with anger sometimes, especially when I think about what happened to me.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s understandable to feel that way. Would you like to discuss some strategies for processing that anger?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I think that would be helpful.  ",P,Insignificant
One technique is to identify specific triggers for your anger and then explore healthier ways to express it.  ,T,Insignificant
Like what?  ,P,Insignificant
"For instance, physical activities like running or even using art to express your feelings can be effective.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I like the idea of using art. I haven’t done that in a while.  ,P,Insignificant
That could be a great outlet for you. Would you be open to trying to create something when you feel that anger rising?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I’ll try that.  ",P,Next Steps
Perfect! Let’s check in on how that goes in our next session. Thank you for being so open today.  ,T,Insignificant
Thank you for your help!  ,P,Insignificant
"Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time!  ",T,Insignificant
Bye!,P,Insignificant
