Hi again! It’s great to see you. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing really well. I’ve been practicing the reframing techniques we talked about.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s fantastic! How has that been going for you?  ,T,Insignificant
"It’s been helpful. I catch myself thinking negatively, but now I try to reframe it, and it works!  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s wonderful progress! Have you noticed any specific situations where this has been particularly useful?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes, there was a time when I felt overwhelmed with work, and instead of thinking I can’t handle it, I reminded myself that I’ve managed before.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great example! It shows you’re building resilience. Have you been able to maintain your social connections as well?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes! I went out with my co-workers again last week, and it was a lot of fun.  ",P,Current Functional Status
That’s great to hear! How did it feel to spend that time with them?  ,T,Insignificant
"It felt really good. I felt included and part of the team, which is nice.  ",P,Current Functional Status
That’s a significant feeling. Building those connections can enhance your overall well-being. Have you experienced any challenges in that area?  ,T,Insignificant
"A little. Sometimes I still feel shy about reaching out to people, but I’m working on it.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s normal to feel shy. What strategies have you been using to overcome that shyness?  ,T,Insignificant
"I remind myself that everyone is just trying to connect, and I try to take small steps, like initiating conversations.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a great approach! It’s all about taking small steps towards building those connections. Have you noticed any changes in your self-confidence?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes! I feel more confident in social situations, which is a nice change.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re really growing. Is there anything specific you’d like to focus on today?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’d like to explore how to handle moments when I feel overwhelmed, especially at work.  ",P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
Absolutely! Let’s start by identifying what specifically overwhelms you at work.  ,T,Insignificant
I think it’s when I have multiple deadlines at once. It feels like too much to handle.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Have you tried any strategies to manage those overwhelming moments?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to prioritize tasks, but sometimes I still feel anxious.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Prioritizing tasks is a great start. We can also explore time management techniques to help with that. Would you like to try that?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I think that would be really helpful.  ",P,Insignificant
"One technique is the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for a set period, then take a short break. Have you heard of it?  ",T,Insignificant
"I think I’ve heard of it, but I’ve never tried it.  ",P,Insignificant
"It can be effective! You work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four cycles, you take a longer break. Would you like to give it a try?  ",T,Insignificant
"Yes, I’d love to! I think it would help me stay focused.  ",P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s also discuss how to manage your expectations during busy times. It’s okay to ask for help or delegate tasks when needed.  ,T,Insignificant
That’s true. I sometimes hesitate to ask for help because I don’t want to seem incompetent.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s important to remember that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. How does that perspective feel?  ",T,Insignificant
It feels good! I need to remind myself of that more often.  ,P,Insignificant
Absolutely! It’s all about collaboration. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?  ,T,Insignificant
"No, I think we’ve covered a lot of ground. I feel really good about everything we talked about!  ",P,Progress Evaluation
I’m glad to hear that! Thank you for your openness today. I look forward to our next session.  ,T,Insignificant
"Me too! Thank you, Ellie.  ",P,Insignificant
Goodbye for now!  ,T,Insignificant
Bye!,P,Insignificant
