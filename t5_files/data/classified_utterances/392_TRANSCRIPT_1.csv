Hi again! It’s great to see you back. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"I've been okay, just trying to keep busy.",P,Insignificant
That’s good to hear. Have you had a chance to practice any of the deep breathing techniques we talked about?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"A little bit, yeah. I’ve tried to do it when I feel stressed, especially when I'm working.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI): Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a great start! How did that work for you?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"It helped a bit, I guess. I felt more relaxed after doing it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI): Therapeutic Interventions
Fantastic! Relaxation techniques can be really effective. Have you noticed any situations where you felt more stressed than usual?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, work has been a bit hectic lately. I feel like I'm constantly under pressure.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I see. What do you think is contributing to that pressure?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I think it’s just the workload and deadlines piling up. I feel like I’m always racing against time.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds overwhelming. How do you usually cope with that feeling?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I try to distract myself with TV or hanging out with friends, but sometimes it feels like it's just postponing the problem.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s understandable to want to escape the pressure. Have you thought about setting boundaries at work to manage your workload better?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I haven’t really considered that. I don’t want to seem like I can’t handle it.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s important to remember that asking for help or setting limits doesn’t mean you can’t handle your work. It can actually lead to better productivity and less stress. ,T,Insignificant
That makes sense. I guess I just worry about what others will think.,P,Insignificant
It’s natural to have those concerns. What if we brainstorm some ways to communicate your needs effectively at work?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I’d like that.",P,Insignificant
Great! How about starting with a simple email to your supervisor about your current workload? You could express your willingness to meet deadlines but also mention feeling overwhelmed.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds doable. I could draft something like that.,P,Insignificant
Excellent! Would you like to try writing that email together now?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, let’s do it.",P,Insignificant
"Okay, let’s start with a greeting. How about, “Hi [Supervisor’s Name], I hope this message finds you well”?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yes, that works. ",P,Insignificant
"Next, you could say something like, “I wanted to discuss my current workload and some challenges I’ve been facing.” ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"That feels a bit nerve-wracking, but I can see how it’s necessary.",P,Insignificant
"It’s completely normal to feel nervous about this. Remember, you’re advocating for yourself. What would you like to say next?",T,Insignificant
"Maybe something like, “I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with the deadlines and would appreciate your guidance on prioritizing tasks.”",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Perfect! That’s assertive yet respectful. How do you feel about that phrasing?,T,Insignificant
I like it. It sounds professional.,P,Insignificant
Great! I think you’re on the right track. Do you want to add anything else?,T,Insignificant
Maybe I could ask for a meeting to discuss it further?,P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Absolutely! You could conclude with, “Could we schedule a time to discuss this further?”",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Okay, I think I have it all written down. ",P,Insignificant
"That’s wonderful! Once you send it, how do you think you’ll feel?",T,Insignificant
I think I’ll feel relieved. Like a weight is lifted off my shoulders.,P,Physiological Observations
"That’s the goal! Taking action can often reduce anxiety. Speaking of anxiety, have you noticed any changes in how you feel since our last session?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I think I’ve been a bit more anxious, especially about work and some personal stuff.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Would you like to explore what’s been causing that anxiety?,T,Insignificant
"Sure, I think it might be related to my sister’s death. I keep thinking about it more lately.",P,Trauma History
That’s understandable. Loss can resurface in different ways. How have those thoughts been affecting you?,T,Insignificant
"I feel sad a lot, and sometimes it hits me out of nowhere. I just miss her.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI): Trauma History
It’s completely normal to miss someone you loved deeply. Would you feel comfortable sharing a specific memory of her that brings you joy?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I remember when we used to go to the beach together. We’d just sit and talk for hours.",P,Trauma History
That sounds beautiful. How does thinking about that memory make you feel now?,T,Insignificant
"It makes me smile, but it also makes me feel sad that I can’t do that anymore.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s okay to feel both emotions. They can coexist. Would you like to talk about ways to honor her memory?,T,Insignificant
I’d like that. Maybe I could write about her?,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Writing can be a powerful way to process your feelings. Would you want to start a journal dedicated to her?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds nice. I could write down memories or lessons she taught me.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a wonderful idea! It can also serve as a way to keep her spirit alive in your life. ,T,Insignificant
I think I’ll try that.,P,Insignificant
I’m glad to hear that. Let’s set a goal for you to write one memory each week. How does that sound?,T,Next Steps
That sounds manageable. I can do that.,P,Next Steps
"Perfect! I look forward to hearing how that goes in our next session. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps.",T,Next Steps
"Thank you, Ellie. This has been really helpful.",P,Insignificant
"You’re welcome! I’m here to support you. Let’s check in next week, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before then.",T,Insignificant
Will do! Bye for now.,P,Insignificant
Bye!,T,Insignificant
