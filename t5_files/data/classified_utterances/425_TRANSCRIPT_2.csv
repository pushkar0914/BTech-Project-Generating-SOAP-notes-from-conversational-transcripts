"Hi, Ellie. I’ve been okay. I did talk to my son about my goals, and it went well.",P,Psychosocial History
That’s wonderful! How did that conversation go?,T,Insignificant
He was really supportive. He even helped me look at some listings together.,P,Psychosocial History
That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’re making progress. How do you feel about the listings you looked at?,T,Insignificant
"There are a couple that seem promising, but I’m still nervous about the whole moving process.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s completely natural to feel nervous about such a big change. What specifically makes you feel nervous?,T,Insignificant
I guess it’s the uncertainty. I worry about affording rent and if I’ll like the new place.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Those are valid concerns. Have you thought about creating a budget to help ease your worries?,T,Insignificant
"I haven’t yet, but that sounds like a good idea.",P,Insignificant

"It felt good to reflect on my experiences, but I still worry if it’s good enough.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s common to feel that way. Remember, your resume is just a tool to showcase your skills. You bring a lot of value that can’t be captured on paper.",T,Insignificant
That’s true. I need to remind myself of that.,P,Insignificant
Absolutely! And how about our mock interview? Are you ready to give it a try today?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I think I’m ready. I’m a little nervous, but I want to practice.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s completely normal. Let’s start with a common question: “Tell me about yourself.”,T,Insignificant
"Okay, um… I have a background in liberal arts and have been working on my skills in personal assisting. I’m very organized and enjoy helping others.",P,Current Functional Status
"That’s a great start! You mentioned your experience and strengths. How about adding a personal touch, like a hobby or interest?",T,Insignificant
"Oh, right! I enjoy writing and watching home improvement shows, which helps me think creatively.",P,Current Functional Status

I feel more confident about it now.,P,Mental Health Observations

"I’d say my ability to listen and empathize with others, and my organizational skills.",P,Current Functional Status
"Those are strong strengths, especially for personal assisting roles. Can you give an example of how you’ve used those strengths?",T,Insignificant
"Sure! In my previous volunteer role, I helped organize events and made sure everyone felt included.",P,Current Functional Status
That’s a wonderful example! It illustrates your skills well. How do you feel about your interview skills now?,T,Insignificant
