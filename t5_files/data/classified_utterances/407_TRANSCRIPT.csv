it's work and then social life and all that so um i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school,P,Current Functional Status
i only have school on the weekdays,P,Current Functional Status
so i actually slept probably like,P,Physiological Observations
eighty five percent of the day so i actually feel kinda good,P,Physiological Observations

maybe like,P,Insignificant
a couple times <ti> well i went there for like a summer,P,Current Functional Status
like in oh,P,Insignificant
eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here,P,Current Functional Status
unfortunately,P,Insignificant
how does it compare to l_a,T,Insignificant
uh <sigh> uh <laughter>,P,Insignificant
uh it compares to l_a,P,Insignificant
um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i,P,Psychosocial History
anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um,P,Psychosocial History
l_a has all the stuff to do it has um,P,Insignificant
oceans and it's by all kinds of um located,P,Insignificant
um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh,P,Insignificant
san diego and what have you not so <s> um,P,Insignificant
but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i don't miss,P,Insignificant
like the actual city,P,Insignificant
i just miss uh some of the people that,P,Insignificant
i grew up with,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot,T,Insignificant
oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of,P,Current Functional Status
california like six times so,P,Current Functional Status
i would like to travel,P,Current Functional Status
once i uh,P,Insignificant
have enough money to do so,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
studying <stu> i was,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
took i took communications and uh,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
did general ed stuff too and um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
took like video production classes and um <tisk>,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
<lip smacking>,P,Insignificant
did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
become an optician so,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
wow,T,Insignificant
but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i still actually i got into um playing poker,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
a few years ago and i really like,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
the idea of becoming,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
extremely difficult to make a living out of and you,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
to be an optician,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yes,T,Insignificant
oh um,P,Insignificant
uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
it just like specifically,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
trains you into um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
all these other classes like you normally would do for like um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si>,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
it sound like something maybe i could do,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um got my attention to be an optician so,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i'm now trying to be an optician,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
and it's interesting so,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
it's fun it's um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
really hard but it's interesting and it,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and it um,P,Insignificant
and it's it's fun it has um rewarding,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant
rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
better and feel comfortable with,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
more comfortable with,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
that's great,T,Insignificant
cool,P,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
uh i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy,P,Insignificant
sometimes like i'm kinda shy right now because,P,Insignificant
talking to you and you're uh in a computer and you're a cartoon,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
or uh animated or whatever <laughter>,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
cool,P,Insignificant
but no usually ninety eight percent,P,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe,P,Insignificant
this might go for some of the poker players too um,P,Insignificant
i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like,P,Insignificant
um i actually,P,Insignificant
playing poker is um,P,Current Functional Status
actually something that,P,Current Functional Status
helps me forget about anything as far as like um,P,Current Functional Status
stuff in the past or present,P,Current Functional Status
um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela>,P,Current Functional Status
i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy,P,Current Functional Status
thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past,P,Current Functional Status
i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however,P,Current Functional Status
playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um,P,Current Functional Status
catch twenty two or whatever but uh,P,Insignificant
hmm,T,Insignificant
yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball,P,Current Functional Status
i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually,P,Current Functional Status
one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does,P,Current Functional Status
um it makes me feel good,P,Physiological Observations
but it i didn't go,P,Insignificant
i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the,P,Insignificant
cold season,P,Insignificant
so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter>,P,Current Functional Status
okay,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like,P,Insignificant
i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and,P,Insignificant
all six of 'em were started by the other person,P,Insignificant
so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but,P,Insignificant
talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like,P,Insignificant
thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been,P,Insignificant
a couple times maybe in the past where like i,P,Insignificant
wasn't able to control it,P,Insignificant
but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would,P,Insignificant
but for um,P,Insignificant
majority of the time yeah i don't have like,P,Insignificant
people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um,P,Insignificant
on the freeway and stuff but uh,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really,P,Insignificant
um petty things i guess that maybe we just,P,Insignificant
i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh,P,Insignificant
we just bumped heads too much so,P,Insignificant
obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
we just argued about,P,Insignificant
girlfriend boyfriend things,P,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
handled differently,P,Insignificant
there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh,P,Insignificant
uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i was um working for,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
production assistant for filmmakers around,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and then i got involved with like uh the wrong,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
group of people i guess and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
those kind of people that kinda of girl,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um uh,P,Insignificant
ever,P,Insignificant
uh because <clears throat> i woulda,P,Insignificant
probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh,P,Insignificant
<sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um,P,Insignificant
not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
hardest decision i guess,P,Insignificant
i guess uh hardest decision,P,Insignificant
the hardest decision i have ever had to make,P,Insignificant
would be um,P,Insignificant
i guess you could say uh i don't really know,P,Insignificant
was gonna say that uh,P,Insignificant
maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like,P,Insignificant
stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh,P,Insignificant
would like to be with her and miss her,P,Insignificant
but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like,P,Insignificant
i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i don't think it would end up working out anyways so,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i guess the decision my hardest decision would be,P,Insignificant
to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and uh,P,Insignificant
be uh not with her so,P,Insignificant
i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um,P,Insignificant
i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been,P,Insignificant
happier in that way but stressed out and,P,Insignificant
um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so,P,Insignificant
it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it,P,Insignificant
not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me,P,Insignificant
or whatever so,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
cool,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
oh what was that,P,Insignificant
i beg your pardon,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
nevad,P,Insignificant
i don't understand the first part of that question,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
oh an event,P,Insignificant
oh an event okay um that i could erase,P,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
uh event that i could from my memory,P,Insignificant
uh my ex girlfriend i wish i'd never met her,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them 'cause uh we <w>,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so,P,Insignificant
i guess both of them,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
oh it's extremely easy i could fall asleep,P,Physiological Observations
anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which would've been weird because i guess i would've,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
fallen down or something i don't know i just caught myself,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
i guess i was really <r> i mean i was really tired but i i do a lot of stuff so it's hard for i don't really get that much sleep,P,Physiological Observations
yeah,T,Insignificant
as much as i would like <l> like but i could sleep when i'm dead or whatever so,P,Insignificant
as they say,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
<tisk> uh no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
uh lately i'm just tired but i'm alright i guess,P,Physiological Observations
i'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month an a week,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but it's actually it's not i mean i've had worse things happen i mean worse things happen,P,Insignificant
had worse things happen so yeah,P,Insignificant
i guess,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
well i'm a religious person i'm catholic i believe in god i know there's a god so um i obviously even all of it even devoted,P,Insignificant
people to god um regardless of what they are they uh sometimes lose faith so i do lose faith sometimes but it doesn't really last for that long and i know that there is a god i know,P,Insignificant
that i'll be okay and that everything will be okay but you know it's hard um deal with them i i don't really i just keep going you know go to school and work,P,Current Functional Status
and i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just,P,Current Functional Status
try to stay busy and,P,Current Functional Status
staying busy helps kind of and like sleeping,P,Current Functional Status
a lot helps but i don't get to sleep a lot so,P,Physiological Observations
um i don't know,P,Insignificant
uh playing poker,P,Current Functional Status
playing basketball,P,Current Functional Status
uh huh,T,Insignificant
deals helps me deal with it and like uh,P,Current Functional Status
hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes,P,Current Functional Status
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
why,P,Insignificant
uh uh,P,Insignificant
uh i felt really happy on friday because um,P,Insignificant
i went to san diego for the first time,P,Current Functional Status
and uh i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought it was gonna be but uh we were like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so,P,Insignificant
i would've much rather been free during that time but i wasn't but we had fun and it was cool uh i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked uh i was had fun and i was,P,Insignificant
happy about going to san diego for the first time and i um,P,Insignificant
had a good time,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
oh,P,Insignificant
she's,P,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
um <laughter>,P,Insignificant
a lot of things but i guess i would say like,P,Insignificant
be nicer to like um,P,Insignificant
family members you know a couple family members that i wish i would've been,P,Insignificant
different to um,P,Insignificant
acted different to not that i was like a horrible but i could've been nicer in some instances that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh,P,Insignificant
i would've never like really um went out and partied all the time like i did,P,Insignificant
like high school and different part times of out of high school i would've just,P,Insignificant
really focused on um schooling and stuff and then,P,Insignificant
did the partying later uh wouldn't have gotten relationships that um so i would've just told myself more basically to be more,P,Insignificant
uh have more direction be more focused i guess uh,P,Insignificant
stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but <sniffle> um yeah i just would've done a lot of stuff different but,P,Insignificant
i um i don't know if i said this earlier but i believe everything happens for a reason,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
so i guess everything's happening,P,Insignificant
now for a reason,P,Insignificant
so i'm just gonna keep going,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
<tisk> i guess they would the few that i do have or few that i used to have 'cause i have best friends now a couple i guess one new one,P,Insignificant
and i've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like went out own ways but i guess they would all probably describe me more as like,P,Insignificant
um happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy,P,Insignificant
uh loud uh,P,Insignificant
silly,P,Insignificant
uh smart,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
i just in i guess in uh in general just like,P,Insignificant
entertaining to be around,P,Insignificant
have,P,Insignificant
i haven't always <a> always been the best bestest best friend but i try you know my hardest,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
so that's it like,P,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
cool,P,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant

<tisk> i wish i was um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History

and so i could that could help me like focus more,P,Insignificant
and i wish that like i didn't need,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
sexual um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i wasn't always thinking about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
me having to be in a sexual,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
thing with them like,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
as far as like wanting sex as much as i do 'cause i feel like,P,Medical and Psychiatric History

well who i don't know how to say it but i'm just saying like i there's like guy friends that i know,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
that don't need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didn't need <n> need it as much so maybe i guess i'm addicted to it a little bit,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
where like i i could focus on more things other than just,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i mean i don't just focus on sex but i just feel like if focus on if i didn't want it need it or think i need it as much that i could get more stuff done in my life,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
