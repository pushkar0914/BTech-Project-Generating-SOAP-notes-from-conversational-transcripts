the just where my life was at it was just in a really good place in many ways,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
um i wish i could change about myself um my anxiety,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
um i wish i could change about myself um my agoraphobia,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
my p_t_s_d um meaning my trauma um and um,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
uh,P,Insignificant
what else um,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
my insecurity uh as far as um,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
just um,P,Insignificant
with <w> with other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that um,P,Insignificant
that i don't do something that that um,P,Insignificant
hold on one second,P,Insignificant
i'm just trying to make sure that um i don't do anything that's um offensive to them or insults them,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
or uh is disrespectful um and i i feel like i'm overly um cautious about that and um,P,Insignificant
it it it kinda becomes um an anxiety unto itself,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
um so i i definitely think that that would be beneficial,P,Insignificant
uh to change um the other thing i'd like to change about myself is i wish i could feel,P,Insignificant
um and also depression i'd like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better um,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
i wish i didn't feel um,P,Insignificant
uh so um,P,Insignificant
uh i didn't wish i didn't have the burden that i do of um,P,Insignificant
my family um of not having one,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and uh what else um i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical,P,Insignificant
um excruciating pain that i'm in uh so those are some things um,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
mhm,T,Insignificant
and i also wish that um,P,Insignificant
and this is um a a by-product of p_t_s_d i wish that i didn't have um,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
the the symptomology,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
of p_t_s_d um 'cause that definitely um,P,Insignificant
affects one's complete <com> complete the complete life like eh a lot their affects their life uh completely,P,Insignificant
um and i i wish i was more articulate,P,Insignificant
and i wish i was um someone who was well-spoken,P,Insignificant
and someone who is well-written,P,Insignificant
um but there's many there's many more um,P,Insignificant
uh things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself,P,Insignificant
so many more,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
<sigh> um,P,Insignificant
i'm not sure uh,P,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
maybe to um not be so trusting um,P,Insignificant
i trusted um,P,Insignificant
i trusted some medical professionals that um,P,Insignificant
you know again created the injury,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
you know were,P,Insignificant
there's a uh,P,Insignificant
what's the word,P,Insignificant
there's an expectation and a sort of a demand to just,P,Insignificant
blindly trust um the medical profession um and,P,Insignificant
<sniffle> um,P,Insignificant
don't ask questions and just sort of um,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
and if and not to trust your own self your own um your own instincts um or intuition,P,Insignificant
um and so i would,P,Insignificant
i would've told myself to be a little more careful um,P,Insignificant
i guess if that's,P,Insignificant
useful to your question,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed,T,Insignificant
um what did i really enjoy um,P,Insignificant
you know i can't think of anything specific um,P,Insignificant
but um,P,Insignificant
i know it would have to do um,P,Insignificant
with either reading or um,P,Insignificant
connecting with someone on a meaningful level,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
i'm most proud of um,P,Insignificant
my compassion,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
my um my uh empathy and caring about people,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
despite um i mean i'm proud of it,P,Insignificant
anyways but um also particularly <sniffle> um i come from a,P,Insignificant
um an environment that's the opposite um a background and um i wasn't taught that <sniffle> um but i really do care about people and um,P,Psychosocial History
i'm i guess i'm most proud of that i'm also proud of my um career,P,Psychosocial History
accomplishments,P,Psychosocial History
um and my um tenacity um my fierce <fie> my fierce tenacity to succeed,P,Psychosocial History
um <sniffle> and uh,P,Insignificant
you know just um also to get um the strength it takes to get through um,P,Insignificant
the injury,P,Trauma History
uh to live with it and to live with the illness um that i live with the physical illness,P,Trauma History
um,P,Insignificant
so i i think that would be it,P,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
