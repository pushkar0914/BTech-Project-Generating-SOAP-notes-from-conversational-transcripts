Hi! It’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Hey, Ellie. I’ve been okay. I actually applied for a couple of jobs like we talked about.",P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
That’s fantastic! How did that feel for you?,T,Insignificant
"It felt good to take that step, but I still feel anxious about it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s completely normal to feel anxious, especially when you’re putting yourself out there. Did you notice any specific thoughts or feelings that came up while applying?",T,Insignificant
"I kept thinking, “What if I don’t get a call back?” It’s like a loop in my head.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That loop can be tough to break. Have you tried any techniques to challenge those thoughts when they arise?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to remind myself that I’m doing my best, but it’s hard to believe it sometimes.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It can be challenging to shift our mindset. One technique is to write down those negative thoughts and then counter them with positive affirmations. Would you like to try that?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I could give that a shot. It might help to see it on paper.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Great! Sometimes visualizing the contrast can help reinforce the positive. How has your journaling been going since we last spoke?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been writing a little, but I still find it hard to get started.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s okay! It’s a process. You might try setting a timer for just two minutes and writing whatever comes to mind. No pressure to make it perfect.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds manageable. I can try that.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Excellent! Now, how about your feelings of hopelessness? Have there been any changes there?",T,Insignificant
"I still have my moments, but I think I’m coping a bit better. I’ve been trying to focus on the small things.",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s a positive shift! Focusing on small victories can help create a sense of hope. What’s one small victory you’ve had recently?,T,Insignificant
I went for a hike last weekend. It was nice to be outdoors and disconnect for a bit.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful! Nature can be very healing. How did you feel during and after the hike?,T,Insignificant
I felt peaceful while I was out there. It was a nice break from everything.,P,Physiological Observations
That’s a great reminder of the power of nature. Is that something you’d like to incorporate more regularly?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I need to make time for that.",P,Next Steps
That sounds like a good plan. Let’s set a goal for you to go hiking or spend time outdoors at least once this week. How does that sound?,T,Next Steps
I can do that!,P,Next Steps
"Awesome! Now, let’s talk about your family dynamics. You mentioned that your relationship with them is dysfunctional. Have you had any contact with them lately?",T,Insignificant
"No, I’ve been keeping my distance. It’s just easier that way.",P,Psychosocial History
That’s understandable. Sometimes distance can provide clarity. How do you feel about that distance?,T,Insignificant
"It’s a relief, but I also feel guilty sometimes.",P,Psychosocial History
Those feelings of guilt are common. It’s important to prioritize your well-being. Would you be open to discussing how you might navigate those feelings?,T,Insignificant
I guess so. I just feel torn between wanting to support them and needing to take care of myself.,P,Psychosocial History
That’s a tough balance to strike. It’s okay to set boundaries for your mental health. What would it look like for you to maintain those boundaries while still being supportive?,T,Insignificant
Maybe I could check in once in a while but not get too involved.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a healthy approach. Checking in can show you care without overwhelming yourself. Would you like to try that this week?,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I think I can manage that.",P,Next Steps
Great! We can check in on how that goes next time. Is there anything else you’d like to address today?,T,Insignificant
"No, I think that’s it. Thanks for helping me work through all of this.",P,Insignificant
"You’re welcome! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, it’s okay to take things one day at a time. I look forward to our next session.",T,Insignificant
"Me too. Bye, Ellie.",P,Insignificant
Goodbye!,T,Insignificant
