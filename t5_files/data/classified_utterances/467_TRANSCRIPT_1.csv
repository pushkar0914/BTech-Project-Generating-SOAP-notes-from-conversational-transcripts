<sigh>  ,P,Insignificant
Hi again! It’s great to see you back. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been okay, I guess. Just the usual ups and downs.  ",P,Insignificant
"That’s understandable. Last time, you mentioned feeling unsure about your direction in life. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke?  ",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, a bit. I've been thinking about what I really want to do, but I'm still not sure.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s a big question. What kind of things have you been considering?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Well, I keep coming back to that idea of working outdoors, like being a forest ranger or something.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a meaningful path. What draws you to that kind of work?  ,T,Insignificant
"I just love nature, you know? Being outside makes me feel alive.  ",P,Psychosocial History
That’s wonderful. Have you looked into any opportunities or programs related to that?  ,T,Insignificant
"A little. I’ve seen some volunteer programs, but I haven’t applied to anything yet.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What’s holding you back from applying?  ,T,Insignificant
I guess I’m just nervous about committing to something. What if I don’t like it?  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valid concern. Have you thought about how you could explore that interest without fully committing right away?  ,T,Insignificant
Maybe I could do some short-term volunteering first?  ,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a great idea! It could give you a taste of what it’s like.  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I’d feel more comfortable with that.  ",P,Insignificant
How do you think you would feel if you tried it and didn’t enjoy it?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’d probably feel disappointed, but I guess it would just mean I need to keep looking for what fits.  ",P,Insignificant
Exactly! It’s all part of the journey. What else have you been feeling uncertain about?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I’m also worried about making friends here in L.A.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a common concern, especially in a new place. Have you had any opportunities to meet new people?  ",T,Insignificant
"I’ve met a few people through classes, but it’s hard to connect deeply.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What do you think makes it difficult for you to connect?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’m just naturally shy, I guess. It takes me a while to open up.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. Would you like to explore some strategies to help ease that process?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’d be open to that.  ",P,Insignificant
One approach is to start with common interests. What are some things you enjoy that you could share with others?  ,T,Insignificant
I like drawing and music.  ,P,Psychosocial History
Those are great! Have you thought about joining a group or club around those interests?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve seen some art classes and music meetups, but I haven’t gone to any yet.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What’s stopping you from attending?  ,T,Insignificant
Just the thought of being in a new group makes me anxious.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s understandable. How about setting a small goal, like attending just one class?  ",T,Next Steps
I think I could do that. Just one class to start.  ,P,Next Steps
"That’s a fantastic plan! And remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. Everyone else there is likely feeling a bit out of their comfort zone too.  ",T,Insignificant
True. I hadn’t thought of it that way.  ,P,Insignificant
How do you typically handle those feelings of anxiety?  ,T,Insignificant
I usually just try to distract myself with music or drawing.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Those are healthy coping mechanisms. Have you tried any mindfulness techniques?  ,T,Insignificant
"Not really. I’ve heard of them, but I don’t know how to start.  ",P,Insignificant
Mindfulness can be a great tool. Would you be interested in trying a simple breathing exercise together?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, I’d like that.  ",P,Insignificant
"Okay, let’s take a moment. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable. Take a deep breath in through your nose... and out through your mouth.  ",T,Insignificant
<inhales and exhales>  ,P,Insignificant
Great. Now focus on your breath. In... and out. Let any thoughts come and go without holding onto them.  ,T,Insignificant
<continues breathing>  ,P,Insignificant
How did that feel?  ,T,Insignificant
It felt nice. I feel a little more relaxed.  ,P,Physiological Observations
That’s wonderful! You can use this technique anytime you’re feeling anxious.  ,T,Next Steps
I’ll definitely try to remember that.  ,P,Insignificant
Is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss today?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I’m good for now.  ,P,Insignificant
"Alright, let’s set a goal for next time. How about you try that art class and practice the mindfulness exercise?  ",T,Next Steps
Sounds good! I’ll try to do both.  ,P,Next Steps
Great! I look forward to hearing how it goes.  ,T,Insignificant
Me too! Thanks for the help today.  ,P,Insignificant
You’re welcome! See you next time!  ,T,Insignificant
Bye!  ,P,Insignificant
Bye!,T,Insignificant
