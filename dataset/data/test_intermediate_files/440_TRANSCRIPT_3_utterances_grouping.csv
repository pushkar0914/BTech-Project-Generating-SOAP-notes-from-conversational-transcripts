History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been doing well, actually! I’ve been focusing on my jewelry and keeping up with my journaling. Yes, I feel more centered. I’m not letting their issues take over my emotions as much. It feels freeing, but I still struggle with guilt sometimes. I’ve been more patient with my kids, and I feel more in control of my emotions. Yes, we had our first check-in last week, and it went really well. We talked about our stressors and how we can support each other better. It felt good to be open and honest. I think it brought us closer. I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about my son’s situation again. I’m worried about his future and how this experience will affect him. I’ve been trying to focus on what I can control and letting go of what I can’t."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I remind myself of the affirmations we talked about, and I try to focus on the positives. I think I could write it down as a mantra and keep it somewhere visible."
Next Steps,I think we can keep having these regular check-ins and maybe even do something fun together. Maybe a date night or even just cooking together. I think it’ll help us reconnect and relieve some of the tension.
