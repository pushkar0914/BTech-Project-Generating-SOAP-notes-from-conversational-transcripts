History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been alright, thank you. Still processing everything.   That's understandable. Last time we talked about your cancer diagnosis and how it's been affecting your thoughts about the future. Have you had any new insights or feelings about that?   I've been trying to stay positive, but some days it's harder than others.   It makes sense to feel that way. Have there been specific moments or triggers that have made it harder?   Yeah, I think when I see my friends making plans for the future, it hits me.   That sounds tough. It’s natural to compare your situation to others. How do you usually cope with those feelings?   That's a healthy approach. Have you been able to do any of those activities recently?   Yes, I went mountain biking last weekend, and it felt good to be out in nature.   That’s wonderful! Being in nature can be very healing. Did you notice any changes in your mood after that experience?   Definitely! I felt a sense of freedom and joy.   Absolutely. It could also help with any anxious thoughts about the future. Speaking of which, have you had any anxious thoughts since our last session?   Excellent! Now, let’s shift gears a little. You mentioned your brother during our last session. How has that relationship been for you lately?   It’s still tough. I worry about him a lot.   Not really. He’s pretty withdrawn.   That must be hard for you. It can be challenging to see someone you care about struggle. Have you thought about ways to support him from a distance?   I’ve tried sending him messages, but he doesn’t respond.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I try to distract myself with exercise or planning trips.   That’s great to hear. It sounds like those moments are really important for you. Have you thought about how to incorporate more of that into your routine?   I see. Nighttime can often amplify those feelings. Have you tried any strategies to manage those thoughts?   That’s a great practice. How has that been working for you?   It helps sometimes, but my mind wanders a lot.   That’s completely normal. Mindfulness is a practice, and it takes time. Would you like to explore some techniques that might help you stay focused during meditation?   One technique is to focus on your breath. You can count each inhale and exhale, which can help anchor your mind. Would you like to try that together?   Great! Let’s take a deep breath in… and out. Now, as you breathe in, count “one,” and as you breathe out, count “two.” Let’s do this for a few moments.   That’s understandable. It sounds like you care deeply for him. Have you been able to communicate with him at all?   That can be frustrating. Sometimes, just letting someone know you’re there for them, even if they don’t respond, can be comforting. Would you like to brainstorm some other ways to support him?   Maybe I could write him a letter.  "
Next Steps,"I’d like to. Maybe I can set a goal to go outside at least once a week.   That sounds like a solid plan. Setting small, achievable goals can be very beneficial. How do you feel about that idea?   I’m glad to hear that. Practicing this regularly can help you manage those anxious moments. Would you like to set a goal for how often you’ll practice this?   Maybe I can try doing it every night before bed.   That’s a lovely idea. Writing can be a great way to express your feelings without pressure. What would you want to say to him?   That’s a powerful message. It’s important for him to know he’s not alone. Would you like to set a goal for when you might write that letter?   I could try to write it by the end of the week.  "
