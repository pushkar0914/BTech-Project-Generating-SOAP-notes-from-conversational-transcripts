History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! I’ve been okay, though the stress of moving is still there.   Yes! I scheduled some time for myself last week and read a book. It felt great!   It was refreshing. I forgot how much I enjoy reading.   I think I’m handling it better. I still have moments, but I feel more equipped now.   Probably the combination of self-care and being more aware of my triggers.   Yes, I asked her, and she expressed that she just wants me to listen when she’s upset.   Yes! She seems more willing to share her feelings with me. It’s a relief.   I’ve been reflecting on my relationship with my husband lately.   We’ve talked about going on a date night, but it’s hard to find the time.   Excellent! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember to be kind to yourself through this process.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been using deep breathing exercises more often. They help, especially when I feel overwhelmed.   I’d like to explore more coping strategies for when anxiety hits hard.   Grounding exercises help bring your focus back to the present moment. It can involve physical sensations, like feeling your feet on the ground or holding a textured object.   You can start by finding a comfortable position, taking a few deep breaths, and then focusing on your surroundings. What do you see, hear, and feel?   Great! You can practice this whenever you feel anxious. It helps to anchor you in the present.  "
Next Steps,I think I’ll talk to my husband tonight and see if we can set a specific date.
