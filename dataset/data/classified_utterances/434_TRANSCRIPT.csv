um,P,Insignificant
that was a kinda easy choice i got some advice from people and,P,Insignificant
i just went into it,P,Insignificant
to do it just just to see what it was,P,Insignificant

and then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so right now i'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um,P,Current Functional Status
yeah they just want people to be certified um not being certified um the experience,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard,P,Medical and Psychiatric History

as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um,P,Mental Health Observations
that,P,Insignificant
i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so,P,Mental Health Observations
i should've just left,P,Insignificant
