Hi there! It’s good to see you again. How did your week go with the goals we set last time?,T,Insignificant
"Hi, Ellie! It was okay. I managed to watch a couple of episodes, but I didn’t get around to crocheting.",P,Current Functional Status
That’s alright! Watching your favorite show is a positive step. What did you enjoy most about the episodes you watched?,T,Insignificant
"I really liked the humor. It made me laugh, which felt good.",P,Mental Health Observations
Laughter can be such a powerful tool. I’m glad it brought you some joy. What do you think stopped you from crocheting?,T,Insignificant
I don’t know. I just kept thinking about how I didn’t have the energy to start.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s understandable. Sometimes just starting can feel like a big hurdle. Would it help if we set a very small goal for crocheting, like just picking up the yarn for a few minutes?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I think I could do that. Just picking it up seems easier.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Absolutely! It’s all about making it manageable. Let’s also check in on how you’ve been feeling emotionally this week. Have there been any ups and downs?,T,Insignificant
"Mostly downs, to be honest. I still feel really tired and unmotivated.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I’m sorry to hear that. It sounds like you’re still carrying a lot of emotional weight. Have there been any specific triggers for those feelings?,T,Insignificant
"Just the usual money worries and feeling alone, I guess.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Those feelings can be really heavy. It’s okay to acknowledge that. Have you had any support from friends or family this week?,T,Insignificant
Not really. I don’t have many people to talk to about this stuff.,P,Psychosocial History
"That can be tough. Sometimes just having someone to talk to can help lighten the load a bit. Would you be open to exploring ways to connect with others, even if it’s just online or through a group?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I might consider that. I just don’t know where to start.,P,Insignificant
That’s okay! We can explore some options together. There are online forums and support groups where people share similar experiences. It could be a safe space for you to connect with others.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds interesting. I’ll think about it.,P,Insignificant
Great! It’s all about finding what feels right for you. Let’s also revisit the financial stress. Have you had a chance to look at your expenses more closely?,T,Insignificant
"I did a little bit. I wrote down my essentials, but I’m still worried about how to manage everything.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great start! Acknowledging your expenses is an important step. Would it help if we brainstormed some potential ways to increase your income or cut back on non-essential expenses?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I think that could help. I just feel stuck.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I understand. Let’s take it one step at a time. What are some skills or talents you have that could potentially be turned into a side gig?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I’m good at makeup and hair. I could maybe do some freelance work.",P,Current Functional Status
That’s a fantastic idea! Freelancing could not only provide some extra income but also help you connect with others. Would you be willing to explore that option?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I could look into it. It sounds more appealing than I thought.,P,Insignificant
That’s the spirit! It’s all about taking small steps that can lead to bigger changes. Let’s also set a couple of goals for this week. Perhaps you can try crocheting for a few minutes and researching freelance opportunities?,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I can do that.",P,Next Steps
"Perfect! I’m excited to hear how it goes. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. You’re doing well by just showing up and being open.",T,Insignificant
"Thanks, Ellie. I appreciate your support.",P,Insignificant
"You’re very welcome! Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you next time.",T,Insignificant
Bye!,P,Insignificant
