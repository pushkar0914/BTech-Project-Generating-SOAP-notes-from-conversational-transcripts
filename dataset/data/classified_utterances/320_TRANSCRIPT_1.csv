Hi again! It’s nice to see you. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been okay, I guess. Just trying to keep busy.  ",P,Insignificant
That’s good to hear. You mentioned feeling a bit uneasy last time. Has that changed at all?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"A little, but I still have those moments where I feel anxious.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I understand. Can you tell me more about what triggers that anxiety for you?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Well, sometimes it’s just random things, like being in crowded places, or even just thinking about the past.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. Crowded places can be overwhelming. Have you tried any techniques to manage that anxiety?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I’ve been trying to use some deep breathing exercises. They help a bit.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a great strategy. How do you feel when you use those techniques?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I feel a little calmer, but it’s not a permanent fix.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s normal for it to take time. How about your sleep? Have you been able to get any better rest?  ,T,Physiological Observations
"Not really. I still have nightmares, and it makes it hard to fall asleep.  ",P,Physiological Observations
I’m sorry to hear that. Have you noticed any specific themes in your nightmares?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Most of the time, it’s related to the trauma. I see faces, and I can’t escape.  ",P,Trauma History
That sounds really distressing. How do you cope when you wake up from those nightmares?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I usually just sit up and try to breathe through it. Sometimes I’ll turn on the TV to distract myself.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a good way to ground yourself. Have you ever considered keeping a journal to write down your feelings after a nightmare?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"I haven’t, but that might help.  ",P,Insignificant
It could be a good way to process those emotions. Would you be willing to give it a try?  ,T,Next Steps
"Sure, I can try that.  ",P,Next Steps
Great! Let’s discuss your progress with the breathing exercises and journaling next time. How does that sound?  ,T,Next Steps
Sounds good.  ,P,Insignificant
I also wanted to check in about your relationship with your son. How’s that going?  ,T,Psychosocial History
"It’s okay. We have our ups and downs, but I try my best.  ",P,Psychosocial History
What’s been the most challenging part of parenting for you lately?  ,T,Psychosocial History
I think it’s just balancing my own feelings and being there for him.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s a tough balance to strike. Have you talked to him about how you’re feeling?  ,T,Psychosocial History
Not really. I don’t want to burden him.  ,P,Psychosocial History
"It’s understandable to feel that way, but sometimes sharing a bit can help strengthen your bond.  ",T,Psychosocial History
I guess you’re right. I just don’t want him to worry.  ,P,Psychosocial History
"It’s a valid concern. Perhaps you could share small bits, just to let him know you’re human too.  ",T,Psychosocial History
I can try that.  ,P,Next Steps
Excellent. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable doing that?  ,T,Next Steps
"Maybe if I write it down first, then I can share it with him.  ",P,Next Steps
That sounds like a good plan! Writing can help clarify your thoughts.  ,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I’ll give it a shot.  ",P,Next Steps
Is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss today?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve been thinking about going back to therapy again.  ,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
That’s an important step. What’s motivating you to return?  ,T,Insignificant
"I feel like I need more support, especially with everything I’ve been through.  ",P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
That’s completely understandable. Seeking support is a sign of strength. Have you thought about what you want to achieve in therapy this time?  ,T,Insignificant
I want to learn how to cope better and maybe find a way to let go of some anger.  ,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
That’s a great goal. Working on coping strategies and processing anger can be very beneficial.  ,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I just don’t know where to start.  ",P,Insignificant
"Starting with small steps, like journaling or even talking to someone you trust, can be a good beginning.  ",T,Next Steps
I can try that.  ,P,Next Steps
"I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s okay to take your time with this process.  ",T,Insignificant
"Thanks, I appreciate that.  ",P,Insignificant
"Before we wrap up, is there anything you’d like to focus on for our next session?  ",T,Insignificant
I’d like to talk more about my nightmares and maybe how to manage them.  ,P,Next Steps
"Absolutely, we can dive deeper into that next time. Thank you for sharing today.  ",T,Insignificant
"Thank you, Ellie.  ",P,Insignificant
"Take care, and I’ll see you next time!  ",T,Insignificant
