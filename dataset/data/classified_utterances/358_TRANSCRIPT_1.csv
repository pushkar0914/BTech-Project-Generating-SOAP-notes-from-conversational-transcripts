"Hi, welcome back! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  ",T,Insignificant
"Hey, Ellie. I've been okay, I guess. A little up and down, but that's usual for me.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I appreciate your honesty. Last time we talked about your feelings of irritability and moodiness. Have you noticed any changes in those feelings?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’ve had some moments where I felt a bit lighter, but then there are days where everything feels heavy again.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. It sounds like you’re experiencing some fluctuations in your mood. What do you think triggers those heavier days?  ,T,Insignificant
"I think it’s mostly stress. Sometimes it’s work-related, or just life in general.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Stress can definitely weigh heavily on us. Have you tried any coping strategies since we last spoke?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to take breaks more often, but it’s hard to disconnect sometimes.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Taking breaks is a good step. What do you do during those breaks?  ,T,Insignificant
I usually just scroll through my phone or watch some YouTube clips.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Those can be good distractions. Have you thought about incorporating any mindfulness or relaxation techniques into your breaks?  ,T,Insignificant
I haven't really tried that. I guess I always thought it wouldn’t work for me.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
It’s worth experimenting with! Mindfulness can help ground you when you're feeling overwhelmed. Would you be open to trying a simple breathing exercise together?  ,T,Insignificant
"Sure, I can give it a shot.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose… and out through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together.  ,T,Insignificant
"*[takes deep breaths]* Okay, that feels a bit calming.  ",P,Physiological Observations
How do you feel after that?  ,T,Insignificant
"A little more relaxed, actually.  ",P,Physiological Observations
That’s wonderful to hear! You can use that technique anytime you feel stress creeping in. Do you think you could try it out this week?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I can do that.  ",P,Next Steps
Fantastic! You mentioned that you’ve been feeling tired lately. Have you been able to improve your sleep at all?  ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I still have those nights where I just can’t fall asleep.  ,P,Physiological Observations
Sleep issues can be really challenging. Have you noticed any patterns or habits that might be contributing to that?  ,T,Insignificant
"I tend to stay up late, especially if I’m playing poker online.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. It can be easy to lose track of time. Would you be willing to set a bedtime for yourself this week?  ,T,Insignificant
I could try that. I usually go to bed around 2 AM. Maybe I can aim for midnight instead.  ,P,Next Steps
That’s a great goal! Setting a consistent bedtime can help improve your sleep quality. How do you feel about that?  ,T,Insignificant
I’m willing to give it a shot.  ,P,Next Steps
"Excellent! Now, you mentioned last time that you have a difficult relationship with your parents. How has that been for you lately?  ",T,Insignificant
"It’s still pretty strained. I try not to think about it too much, but sometimes it just comes up.  ",P,Psychosocial History
It’s understandable that those feelings would resurface. Have you found any ways to cope with those feelings when they do come up?  ,T,Insignificant
I vent to my sisters sometimes. They get it.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s a healthy outlet. It’s important to have people to talk to who understand your experiences. Do you feel like you’re able to express your feelings to them openly?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think so. They know what I’ve been through.  ",P,Psychosocial History
That’s great! Support from family can be really beneficial. Have you thought about setting any boundaries with your parents to protect your emotional well-being?  ,T,Insignificant
I haven’t really thought about it. I guess I just avoid them.  ,P,Psychosocial History
"Avoidance can be a natural response, but sometimes it can lead to unresolved feelings. Would you be open to exploring what boundaries might look like for you?  ",T,Insignificant
I guess I could think about it.  ,P,Next Steps
"That’s a good start! You don’t have to make any decisions right away, but reflecting on what you need could be helpful.  ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’ll think about it.  ",P,Next Steps
"Wonderful! Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss today?  ",T,Insignificant
Not really. I feel like we covered a lot.  ,P,Insignificant
"I’m glad to hear that! So to recap, you’ll try the breathing exercise, aim for a midnight bedtime, and reflect on boundaries with your parents. How does that sound?  ",T,Insignificant
Sounds good to me.  ,P,Insignificant
Great! I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care until then!  ,T,Insignificant
"Thanks, Ellie. Bye!  ",P,Insignificant
Bye!,T,Insignificant
