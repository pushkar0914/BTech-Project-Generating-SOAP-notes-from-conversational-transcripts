it was ,P,Insignificant
do you still go to therapy now,T,Insignificant
i no <n> do not,P,Medical and Psychiatric History

and uh ,P,Insignificant
and that seemed to help a lot ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

that it there has it's been a long time ,P,Insignificant

i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mhm,T,Insignificant
um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've ,P,Insignificant
gotten rid of themselves a long time ago ,P,Insignificant
but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
there's gotta be a silver lining ,P,Insignificant

i i would tell myself um to um ,P,Insignificant
that it's not selfish ,P,Insignificant
to let go of a bad situation ,P,Insignificant
and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself ,P,Insignificant
yeah ,T,Insignificant
