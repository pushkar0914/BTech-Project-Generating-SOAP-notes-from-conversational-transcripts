for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit,P,Psychosocial History
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and,P,Psychosocial History
it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine,P,Psychosocial History
which is near the uh,P,Insignificant
galilee,P,Insignificant
and in a place called uh uh,P,Insignificant
i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but,P,Insignificant
uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um,P,Psychosocial History
a house for that welcomes,P,Insignificant
um christian uh,P,Insignificant
pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims,P,Insignificant
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the ,P,Psychosocial History
it's totally ancient but um,P,Insignificant
most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um,P,Psychosocial History
live,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself an introvert,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
not at all,P,Insignificant
why,T,Insignificant
just don't,P,Insignificant
i you know all my life i've always been,P,Insignificant
open and and uh willing to socialize and,P,Insignificant
i remember my younger brother always,P,Insignificant
um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody,P,Psychosocial History
just because i enjoy learning about other people,P,Psychosocial History
that's good,T,Insignificant
what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family,P,Current Functional Status
um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then,P,Current Functional Status
um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband,P,Current Functional Status
and just relax that's what we do and you know,P,Current Functional Status
'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so,P,Insignificant
i like to watch crime dramas,P,Current Functional Status
nice,T,Insignificant
what are some things that make you really mad,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
really mad probably not a lot um,P,Insignificant
i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
almost ever,P,Insignificant
so that that gets me angry but um,P,Insignificant
in terms of like really um,P,Insignificant
getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like,P,Insignificant
little things that my children do to you know,P,Insignificant
especially my oldest child who's twenty one,P,Insignificant
you know he can be confrontational so,P,Insignificant
other than that nothing gets me like really angry,P,Insignificant
haven't i haven't haven't felt that,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what's the best thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
um contributing to society helping uh,P,Insignificant
helping,P,Insignificant
to raise um responsible people i guess um,P,Insignificant
and of course the love and the affection and the um,P,Insignificant
the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go,P,Insignificant
i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children,P,Current Functional Status
are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults,P,Psychosocial History
so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and,P,Current Functional Status
all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh,P,Insignificant
challenging discussions and that sort of thing,P,Insignificant
so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and,P,Insignificant
you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
what's the hardest thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you're never not a parent,P,Insignificant
you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first,P,Insignificant
with my first child um,P,Insignificant
thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot,P,Insignificant
um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but,P,Insignificant
i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it it it uh,P,Insignificant
in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
always,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in  your life,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry,P,Insignificant
i didn't get what you said,P,Insignificant
what are some things you like to do for fun who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life ,T,Insignificant
um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church,P,Psychosocial History
um and my faith,P,Psychosocial History
uh but also my husband he's been a really um,P,Psychosocial History
he's kind of he's very,P,Insignificant
like logical thinking and very you know grounded,P,Insignificant
so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always,P,Insignificant
we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out,P,Insignificant
it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life,P,Psychosocial History
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper,P,Insignificant
um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like,P,Insignificant
rarely do i have outbursts um,P,Insignificant
i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up,P,Insignificant
so with you know like my husband and i don't,P,Insignificant
rarely fight like have,P,Insignificant
arguments that are,P,Insignificant
yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens,P,Insignificant
because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something,P,Insignificant
i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know he thinks he knows everything,P,Insignificant
he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality ,P,Insignificant
and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and,P,Insignificant
you know as life goes on he'll learn more,P,Insignificant
he's very confident and very self uh,P,Insignificant
self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
he still has a lot of learning to do that's all,P,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
it is it can be mhm,P,Insignificant
what do you think of today's kids,T,Insignificant
i think um,P,Insignificant
that many of them are um,P,Insignificant
spoiled and live in an environment of uh,P,Insignificant
of instant gratification,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
which i think is gonna be,P,Insignificant
um detrimental to the to the future of this country,P,Insignificant
but um,P,Insignificant
you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i,P,Insignificant
i have um hope that um,P,Insignificant
they will,P,Insignificant
i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
hopefully our our the next generation and the,P,Insignificant
the generations after that,P,Insignificant
can maintain that um,P,Insignificant
that standard of living i don't know if it's possible,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
mm as,P,Insignificant
loving nurturing um,P,Insignificant
funny,P,Insignificant
we laugh a lot and um,P,Insignificant
caring honest,P,Insignificant
things that uh,P,Insignificant
i mean my best i have ,P,Insignificant
well actually my best friend is,P,Insignificant
it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um,P,Psychosocial History
we,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
for some years,P,Insignificant
took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close,P,Psychosocial History
have a very close relationship with them still do,P,Psychosocial History
and so um i'm considered the fourth sister,P,Psychosocial History
so i would say that those are my best friends and and um,P,Psychosocial History
we love each other very much,P,Psychosocial History
it's a good relationship,P,Psychosocial History
aw,T,Insignificant
have you ever served in the military,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
most,P,Insignificant
how long ago were you diagnosed,T,Insignificant
mostly,P,Insignificant
mm minorly depression it was more anxiety,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um probably um,P,Insignificant
um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
mhm,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
other than that i i you know so,P,Insignificant
depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um but now it's under control so,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i have a great,P,Insignificant
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
huh,P,Insignificant
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
oh,T,Insignificant
in my brain,P,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um,P,Current Functional Status
we had a ,P,Insignificant
good family gatherings,P,Current Functional Status
a little stressed because um,P,Insignificant
we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um,P,Psychosocial History
and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of,P,Psychosocial History
some renovation and some,P,Psychosocial History
to help and some obviously moving around,P,Psychosocial History
and so we're in the throws of that and um,P,Psychosocial History
so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because,P,Psychosocial History
really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties,P,Psychosocial History
so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them,P,Psychosocial History
i understand,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
not easy usually,P,Physiological Observations
all of my life i think i've always,P,Insignificant
i mean i'm not i've always had um,P,Insignificant
at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night,P,Physiological Observations
why,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
to go to the bathroom basically,P,Physiological Observations
oh,T,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning,P,Physiological Observations
then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then,P,Current Functional Status
go back to bed and,P,Insignificant
go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are,P,Insignificant
have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors,P,Insignificant
that sucks,T,Insignificant
yeah sometimes it does,P,Insignificant
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know,P,Physiological Observations
but um,P,Insignificant
i think overall probably the same,P,Insignificant
my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful,P,Current Functional Status
okay,T,Insignificant
they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know,P,Current Functional Status
they may pitch in a little bit more,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
uh not really,P,Insignificant
not not no,P,Insignificant
not really,P,Insignificant
not anything significant,P,Insignificant
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Insignificant
huh,P,Insignificant
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Insignificant
um actually yes i do,P,Insignificant
i do feel like therapy is useful,P,Insignificant
tell me more about that,T,Insignificant
um well uh we had a situation with my daughter,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
she also suffers from anxiety and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish,P,Psychosocial History
a group with her that was a six month um,P,Psychosocial History
uh,P,Insignificant
group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a ,P,Psychosocial History
it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
it's been really good it's been,P,Psychosocial History
very helpful it's just all about,P,Psychosocial History
how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental,P,Psychosocial History
um strategies to keep your uh keep you from,P,Psychosocial History
your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know,P,Psychosocial History
in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter,P,Psychosocial History
and it's been really um,P,Insignificant
really informational and really helpful i think,P,Psychosocial History
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
oh my daughter was um she was,P,Psychosocial History
in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and,P,Psychosocial History
we knew it and um,P,Psychosocial History
we acted on it that's all,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
really joyful and happy i would say probably,P,Insignificant
when,P,Insignificant
probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan,P,Psychosocial History
aw,T,Insignificant
 uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful,P,Psychosocial History
um and it was it happened that our anniversary was,P,Insignificant
we left on our anniversary day flew to israel,P,Psychosocial History
so it was right at the same time,P,Insignificant
it was beautiful,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
very meaningful,P,Insignificant
and other than that i would say you know like,P,Insignificant
uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and,P,Psychosocial History
you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three,P,Psychosocial History
on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so,P,Psychosocial History
what are some things that usually put you in a good mood,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
um that's an interesting question i would say,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm,P,Insignificant
have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or,P,Current Functional Status
errands to run once i get them done,P,Current Functional Status
i feel like a sense of accomplishment,P,Current Functional Status
you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um,P,Current Functional Status
you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things,P,Current Functional Status
you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know,P,Current Functional Status
so i think that would be you know for me the most um,P,Insignificant
most recent,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
way of feeling good and feeling you know,P,Insignificant
like feeling accomplished,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
dream job hm,P,Insignificant
i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
really,T,Insignificant
yeah and um,P,Insignificant
so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends,P,Psychosocial History
and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in,P,Psychosocial History
the birth the bringing of new life into this world so,P,Psychosocial History
i would say that's probably,P,Insignificant
was my was a dream job and i didn't know it,P,Insignificant
i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um,P,Insignificant
was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore,P,Psychosocial History
actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed,P,Psychosocial History
but um,P,Insignificant
i like i said i do it for family members,P,Psychosocial History
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident,P,Psychosocial History
she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends,P,Psychosocial History
and,P,Insignificant
her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave,P,Psychosocial History
i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth,P,Psychosocial History
which is a whole different experience,P,Insignificant
so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery,P,Psychosocial History
uh huh,T,Insignificant
but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you,P,Psychosocial History
even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like,P,Psychosocial History
so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood,P,Psychosocial History
um about fifteen years ago,P,Psychosocial History
'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old,P,Psychosocial History
so um,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
and i've been,P,Insignificant
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but,P,Psychosocial History
uh and you know also like,P,Insignificant
for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business,P,Psychosocial History
and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me,P,Psychosocial History
so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby,P,Psychosocial History
i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter] ,P,Psychosocial History
it was in the middle of the night she was like ,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter],P,Psychosocial History
so um,P,Insignificant
[laughter],T,Insignificant
it went really fast but other than that,P,Insignificant
you know um,P,Insignificant
yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do,P,Psychosocial History
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
in all of life or in your job,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Insignificant
uh probably my my own birth,P,Psychosocial History
i mean my the birth of my own children,P,Psychosocial History
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
like there's an extreme,P,Insignificant
sense of joy excitement relief,P,Insignificant
because of course you're out of the pain,P,Insignificant
and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know,P,Insignificant
going forward from there but it's,P,Insignificant
it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome,P,Psychosocial History
after you give birth,P,Insignificant
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
and i have experienced both ways i've done both um,P,Psychosocial History
natural and,P,Insignificant
my last child was via c_section so i've had both,P,Psychosocial History
both um experiences,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little,P,Insignificant
psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny,P,Psychosocial History
[laughter],T,Insignificant
and um she,P,Insignificant
she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was,P,Insignificant
born very quickly after he broke the water and oof,P,Insignificant
my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble,P,Insignificant
because i only had like two contractions after that,P,Insignificant
oh no,T,Insignificant
my daughter was born in the bed,P,Insignificant
so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but,P,Insignificant
um i'm sure they weren't happy,P,Insignificant
to fill out a lot of paper work after that,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
ten or twenty years ago i was probably more,P,Insignificant
not as um,P,Insignificant
relaxed not as um,P,Insignificant
like i feel now at my age that um,P,Insignificant
i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about,P,Insignificant
uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care,P,Insignificant
you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever,P,Insignificant
so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that,P,Insignificant
you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things,P,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,P,Insignificant
most proud of um,P,Insignificant
probably my family my my husband and my,P,Psychosocial History
my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've,P,Psychosocial History
we're an in tact family that,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
my kids see every day how,P,Psychosocial History
their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and,P,Psychosocial History
they um,P,Insignificant
they actually express,P,Insignificant
gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family,P,Psychosocial History
so i would say that's probably it,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
probably the,P,Insignificant
one of my best qualities is,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
being able to listen to people and being able to um,P,Insignificant
not be judgmental um,P,Insignificant
through the years i've had a ,P,Insignificant
a lot of experience with um,P,Insignificant
people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and,P,Psychosocial History
it's just taught me that um,P,Insignificant
everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems,P,Insignificant
and um i don't think i'm better than someone else,P,Insignificant
if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
okay i think i've asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
goodbye,P,Insignificant
