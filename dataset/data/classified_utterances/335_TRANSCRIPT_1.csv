That sounds challenging. Have you considered ways to express your feelings to him?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve thought about writing him a letter. I could say everything I want to without putting him on the spot.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions

"Yeah, I guess I just don’t want to seem like I’m complaining all the time.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s okay to share your struggles. It doesn’t mean you’re complaining; it’s about being honest with those you trust.  ,T,Insignificant
That makes sense. I’ll try to be more open.  ,P,Progress Evaluation
"That’s a positive step. Speaking of openness, how have you been feeling about your dreams since we last spoke?  ",T,Insignificant
"They’ve been pretty much the same. Still those stress dreams, mostly about my dad.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Now, let’s tense your shoulders for a few seconds… and release. How does that feel?  ",T,Insignificant
