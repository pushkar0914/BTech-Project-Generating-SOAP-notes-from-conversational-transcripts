"I’ve been okay. I tried the breathing technique before talking to my ex, and it helped a bit.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful to hear! Can you tell me more about that experience?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I was feeling frustrated again, but I took a moment to breathe before responding. It kept me from getting too heated.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a significant step forward. It sounds like you’re becoming more aware of your emotions in those moments.,T,Mental Health Observations
"Yes, I think I am. It felt good to not let it escalate this time.",P,Mental Health Observations
Excellent! How did your ex respond when you approached the conversation calmly?,T,Insignificant
"He seemed surprised, honestly. It was different from our usual arguments.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a positive outcome. It shows that your efforts are making a difference. How do you feel about continuing to use this technique?,T,Insignificant
I definitely want to keep using it. It’s nice to feel more in control.,P,Mental Health Observations
"That’s great to hear. Now, how has your studying for the real estate exam been going?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve stuck to the study schedule, and I feel like I’m absorbing more information.",P,Current Functional Status
Fantastic! Have you encountered any challenging topics that you’d like to discuss?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I’m struggling with some of the financing concepts. They’re a bit confusing.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Would you like to dive deeper into those concepts together?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, please. ",P,Insignificant
Let’s break it down. What specifically about financing do you find confusing?,T,Insignificant
I guess it’s the different types of mortgages and how they work.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common area of difficulty. Would it help to go over a few examples of different mortgages together?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, that would be helpful.",P,Insignificant
"Alright, let’s start with fixed-rate mortgages. They have a consistent interest rate over the life of the loan. How does that sound so far?",T,Insignificant
That makes sense. ,P,Insignificant
"Good! And then there are adjustable-rate mortgages, which can change over time. ",T,Insignificant
"Right, I think I get that now. ",P,Insignificant
"Great progress! As you study, remember to take notes on what you find challenging, and we can address those in future sessions.",T,Next Steps
I’ll do that. ,P,Insignificant
"Now, let’s shift gears a bit. You mentioned wanting to lose weight and be more active. How has that been going for you?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to walk more, but it’s tough to stay motivated.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Staying motivated can be challenging. Have you considered setting small, achievable goals for your physical activity?",T,Insignificant
I haven’t really thought about that. ,P,Insignificant
Setting goals can help you track your progress and keep you motivated. What if you aimed for a 20-minute walk a few times a week?,T,Next Steps
That sounds doable. ,P,Insignificant
Excellent! Let’s set that as a goal for your next session. How do you feel about that?,T,Insignificant
I feel good about it. ,P,Insignificant
"Wonderful! As we wrap up, remember to continue using your breathing techniques, stick to your study schedule, and start incorporating those walks. ",T,Next Steps
I will. Thank you for your help!,P,Insignificant
