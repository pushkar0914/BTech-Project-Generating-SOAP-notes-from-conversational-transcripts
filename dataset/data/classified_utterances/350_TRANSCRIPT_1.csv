Hi again! It's good to see you. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"Hi, Ellie! I've been okay, I guess. Some days are better than others.  ",P,Insignificant
I understand. Can you tell me more about what has been better or worse?  ,T,Insignificant
"Well, I had a few good days where I felt more motivated. But then I had a couple of rough days where I felt really low.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds challenging. What do you think triggered those rough days?  ,T,Insignificant
I think it was just a mix of stress from work and feeling overwhelmed with everything going on in my life.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. Have you been able to use any coping strategies we discussed last time?  ,T,Insignificant
"A little bit. I've been journaling more, and it does help sometimes.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That's great to hear! What have you been writing about?  ,T,Insignificant
Mostly my feelings and some of the things that have been bothering me. It helps to get it out of my head.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Absolutely, expressing your thoughts can be very therapeutic. Have you noticed any patterns in your writing?  ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I noticed that I often write about feeling inadequate or comparing myself to others.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s an important insight. Can you tell me more about those feelings of inadequacy?  ,T,Insignificant
"I guess I just feel like I should be doing more with my life. Sometimes I see friends achieving things, and I feel stuck.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s common to feel that way, especially when comparing ourselves to others. How do you usually respond to those feelings?  ",T,Insignificant
I tend to withdraw and isolate myself when I feel that way.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s understandable. Isolation can feel like a safe option, but it can also make things harder. Have you tried reaching out to anyone during those times?  ",T,Insignificant
Not really. I usually just keep it to myself.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Would you be open to trying to reach out to someone next time you feel that way?  ,T,Insignificant
I could try that. Maybe talking to someone would help.  ,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a positive step. Who do you think you might reach out to?  ,T,Insignificant
Probably my aunt. She’s always been supportive.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s a great choice! It sounds like you have a strong connection with her.  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I do. She always knows how to make me feel better.  ",P,Psychosocial History
Have you had a chance to talk to her recently?  ,T,Insignificant
Not in a while. I’ve been so busy with work and everything.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
How about setting a goal to have a chat with her this week?  ,T,Next Steps
That would be nice. I’ll try to make time for that.  ,P,Next Steps
Wonderful! Let’s also talk about your sleep. Have there been any changes since we last spoke?  ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I still struggle with falling asleep and staying asleep.  ,P,Physiological Observations
I see. Have you tried any new techniques to help with your sleep?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to meditate before bed, but sometimes my mind just races.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Meditation can be tricky, especially if your mind is busy. Would you be interested in exploring some guided meditation resources?  ",T,Next Steps
"Yes, that could be helpful.  ",P,Next Steps
Great! I can share some links with you after our session. Have you noticed any particular thoughts that keep you up at night?  ,T,Insignificant
Mostly just worries about work and my future.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. It can be hard not to think about those things. Have you tried writing down your worries before bed?  ,T,Insignificant
"No, I haven’t thought about that.  ",P,Insignificant
It might help to get those thoughts out on paper. You could even write a short list of things you can address tomorrow.  ,T,Next Steps
That sounds like a good idea. I’ll give it a try.  ,P,Next Steps
Excellent! How have you been feeling about your work situation?  ,T,Insignificant
It’s been tough. I feel like I’m not making the impact I want to.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What do you feel is holding you back from making that impact?  ,T,Insignificant
I think it’s a mix of my own self-doubt and the limitations of the tutoring job.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. What changes would you like to see in your work?  ,T,Insignificant
I’d love to get back into teaching full-time. I miss it.  ,P,Next Steps
That’s a great goal! What steps do you think you could take to move closer to that?  ,T,Insignificant
I could start looking for teaching positions and maybe take some workshops to improve my skills.  ,P,Next Steps
Those sound like actionable steps! Would you like to set a timeline for that?  ,T,Next Steps
"Yes, I think I could aim to start looking by next month.  ",P,Next Steps
That sounds like a solid plan. Let’s check in on that next session.  ,T,Next Steps
Sure!  ,P,Insignificant
"Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss?  ",T,Insignificant
Not really. I feel like we covered a lot today.  ,P,Insignificant
I agree! You’ve made some great insights today. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.  ,T,Insignificant
"Thank you, Ellie! I appreciate your help.  ",P,Insignificant
"You’re welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you soon.  ",T,Insignificant
Bye!  ,P,Insignificant
