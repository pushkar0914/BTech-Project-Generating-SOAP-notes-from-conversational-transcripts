and uh i'm,P,Insignificant
starting to get over it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so,P,Trauma History
i've been depressed about that and uh,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh but i'm doing better,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that's good,T,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
it depends on the atmosphere um,P,Insignificant
if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm,P,Insignificant
kinda reserved,P,Insignificant
but uh,P,Insignificant
if i'm comfortable,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant

i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and,P,Insignificant
i try to pick a movie that's uh,P,Insignificant
from back then people were different than they,P,Insignificant
uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it,P,Insignificant
awesome,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
<sigh> well,P,Insignificant
my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but,P,Insignificant
uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but um,P,Insignificant
i'm working on it and,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
oh yes <laughter>,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
<sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter,P,Insignificant
but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young,P,Insignificant
uh follows you for the rest of your life and,P,Insignificant
i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
uh me and my wife we,P,Insignificant
we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree,P,Insignificant
and it's,P,Insignificant
she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh,P,Insignificant
uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is,P,Insignificant
a determined strong willed woman and <sniff>,P,Insignificant
i am who i am so,P,Insignificant
we kinda go back and forth and,P,Insignificant
lately i have been the one to <sigh>,P,Insignificant
bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run,P,Insignificant
it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and,P,Insignificant
having an ego bigger than my common sense and um,P,Insignificant
that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh,P,Insignificant
i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um,P,Insignificant
getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but,P,Insignificant
when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and,P,Insignificant
<sniff>,P,Insignificant
if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
you know ran where,P,Insignificant
people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
hardest decision i ever had to make was,P,Insignificant
giving the authorization to,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed,P,Trauma History
<sigh> and um,P,Insignificant
doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him,P,Insignificant
<sigh> go through any suffering,P,Insignificant
to,P,Insignificant
let him slip away,P,Insignificant
and as you can see i get very upset my uncle,P,Trauma History
raised me like his own son and,P,Trauma History
never let me down,P,Insignificant
<sniff> and he's gone and,P,Insignificant
for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff>,P,Trauma History
but as i said i'm getting over it and um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
things are getting better slowly,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself,P,Psychosocial History
um <coughs> we enjoy,P,Insignificant
uh uh doing simple things,P,Insignificant
it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company,P,Psychosocial History
uh we like the same things and uh we,P,Insignificant
you know occasionally go out and do something together but we,P,Insignificant
<clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she,P,Insignificant
like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes,P,Psychosocial History
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
lately,P,Insignificant
well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do,P,Insignificant
a rigorous activity or something that,P,Insignificant
really uh stresses me or strains my body,P,Insignificant
it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much,P,Insignificant
i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours,P,Physiological Observations
i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but,P,Insignificant
i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep,P,Physiological Observations
i'll stay up all day and,P,Insignificant
i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but,P,Insignificant
you know for me i'm,P,Insignificant
it doesn't affect me,P,Insignificant
hmm,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
<sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but um <sniff>,P,Insignificant
i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
recently well i can't say recently this was back in january,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
my wife and a few uh friends were,P,Insignificant
noticing that i was um,P,Insignificant
becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i i didn't see it and um,P,Insignificant
you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to,P,Insignificant
but anyway i went to the doctor and um,P,Insignificant
they gave me the tests,P,Insignificant
and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh,P,Diagnostic Impressions
i've,P,Insignificant
over the last month or so,P,Insignificant
nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but,P,Insignificant
the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me,P,Next Steps
um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but,P,Insignificant
um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh,P,Diagnostic Impressions
it it could've been due also i was told by him,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better,P,Next Steps
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
i'm not understanding you i'm sorry,P,Insignificant

um,P,Insignificant
i was,P,Insignificant
in a um,P,Insignificant
uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff>,P,Insignificant
i was in a um,P,Insignificant
in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh worrying and thinking too much about things and,P,Insignificant
uh thinking the worst and uh,P,Insignificant
i i take medication for that,P,Medications
do you still go to therapy now,T,Insignificant
uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's,P,Insignificant
<clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter>,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so,P,Insignificant
it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would,P,Insignificant
i would do something the medication works for me,P,Medications
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
last time i felt real happy,P,Insignificant
well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um,P,Insignificant
i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff>,P,Insignificant
when i'm outside of that circle,P,Insignificant
i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content,P,Insignificant
i'm not,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so,P,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
well um <sniff>,P,Insignificant
i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff>,P,Insignificant
well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff>,P,Insignificant
she would um,P,Insignificant
describe me as uh,P,Insignificant
i don't think before i speak,P,Insignificant
um i um,P,Insignificant
let the littlest insignificant things,P,Insignificant
bother me and i get angry over,P,Insignificant
but the big things it's like,P,Insignificant
i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um,P,Insignificant
uh <vocal fry> years and years ago,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender,P,Insignificant
and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby,P,Insignificant
and i <sigh>,P,Insignificant
you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought,P,Insignificant
<laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
and uh she goes you know you,P,Insignificant
you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money,P,Insignificant
you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
that's the only way i can explain it,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life,P,Physiological Observations
and i'm finding it a little bit harder,P,Insignificant
um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power,P,Insignificant
to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or,P,Insignificant
you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were,P,Insignificant
a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more,P,Insignificant
i guess it's we're a little bit older now and,P,Insignificant
<laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh,P,Insignificant
i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh>,P,Physiological Observations
okay,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
<sigh> uh lately,P,Insignificant
no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff>,P,Insignificant
everything's been fine the,P,Insignificant
like i say the,P,Insignificant
the biggest,P,Insignificant
biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever,P,Insignificant
in a hundred years or ever thought that i would,P,Insignificant
face that,P,Insignificant
situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but,P,Insignificant
they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter>,P,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
don't listen to other people,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh,P,Insignificant
he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they,P,Insignificant
um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think,P,Insignificant
they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i wish i could've changed some things um,P,Insignificant
<coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody,P,Insignificant
and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do,P,Insignificant
uh i don't miss them but,P,Insignificant
if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made,P,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff>,P,Psychosocial History
uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat>,P,Psychosocial History
uh people that i know say that i'm uh,P,Insignificant
well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh,P,Insignificant
restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but,P,Insignificant
i've been told that,P,Insignificant
once or twice but i i've kind of,P,Insignificant
i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but,P,Insignificant
i just don't feel the motivation no more,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
well thank you,P,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
bye bye,P,Insignificant
