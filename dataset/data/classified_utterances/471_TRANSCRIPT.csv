experiencing different cultures,P,Psychosocial History
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
uh well uh i love going to mexico,P,Psychosocial History
and uh eh it's so much diffferent from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico is a western civilization but,P,Insignificant
uh the uh the level of,P,Insignificant
of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh they're like two different worlds,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
traveling you mean,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua,P,Insignificant
and it's a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes,P,Insignificant
and uh it's a place where you go to go surfing and it it is an incredible,P,Insignificant
uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place,P,Insignificant
nice,T,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
i studied biology,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
uh i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and uh he wanted me to become a medical doctor also,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
are you still working in that,T,Insignificant
not at all i'm working in,P,Insignificant
areas of business now,P,Insignificant
are you happy you did that,T,Insignificant
yes i am,P,Insignificant
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
my dream job would be to be a missionary,P,Insignificant
really,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
my father's initial objective when he became an m_d was to become a missionary and uh he's a very,P,Insignificant
generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily,P,Insignificant
but uh i would like to help people eh and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's uh disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket,P,Insignificant
i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
i exercise,P,Current Functional Status
okay,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i think i'm pretty good at it uh,P,Insignificant
uh i think i'm pretty effective at it,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and it was about her uh lack of consideration,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i felt frustrated,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
a situation which,P,Insignificant
i wished i could handle differently um,P,Insignificant
i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh,P,Insignificant
be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that,P,Insignificant
is so wrong,P,Insignificant
and so,P,Insignificant
in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my,P,Insignificant
displeasure with someone's actions right away and that,P,Insignificant
uh takes care of the anger immediately,P,Insignificant
has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think,P,Insignificant
eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end,P,Insignificant
uh it diffuses trouble rather than,P,Insignificant
prolongs or protracts the trouble,P,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh at length for many,P,Insignificant
months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to,P,Insignificant
i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh,P,Insignificant
uh difficult period,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
in my life,P,Insignificant
i see,T,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their,P,Insignificant
uh betrayals uh but now i realize that,P,Insignificant
keeping those memories make me who i am today and,P,Insignificant
and dealing with them defines who i am today,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that,P,Psychosocial History
um even though my father was somewhat of a uh,P,Insignificant
hard-handed uh,P,Insignificant
and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died,P,Insignificant
and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother,P,Insignificant
but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect,P,Psychosocial History
me also just,P,Insignificant
just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil,P,Insignificant
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um,P,Insignificant
he's clinically depressed,P,Risk Assessment
and he has suicidal tendencies,P,Risk Assessment
and uh he's not working he's very highly educated,P,Insignificant
and he uh well he doesn't talk to me,P,Insignificant
and uh his family is very abusive towards him it's an not a happy relationship for his family,P,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my uh model,P,Insignificant
he's my uh archetype for what a man should be uh he's he was unimpeachably honest,P,Insignificant
and kind,P,Insignificant
uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Physiological Observations
eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two,P,Physiological Observations
and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress,P,Insignificant
i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay,P,Insignificant
that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future,P,Insignificant
about whether,P,Insignificant
i will survive this or not,P,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
not really,P,Insignificant
do you feel down,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
never,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
never,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
oh i was either surfing or snowboarding,P,Insignificant
or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion,P,Insignificant
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
funny,P,Insignificant
jovial,P,Insignificant
uh uh intelligent a perfectionist,P,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um,P,Insignificant
maybe,P,Insignificant
uh is to submerge my uh,P,Insignificant
hedonistic self,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um,P,Insignificant
uh deferrer of gratification,P,Insignificant
he,P,Insignificant
put,P,Insignificant
now behind him and he put what will be in the future,P,Insignificant
in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was,P,Insignificant
whereas i am looking always for the present,P,Insignificant
um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to,P,Insignificant
uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself,T,Insignificant
<deep breath> it would be,P,Insignificant
my ex-boss,P,Insignificant
and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using,P,Insignificant
uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way,P,Insignificant
and he continued to use more profanity,P,Insignificant
until uh,P,Insignificant
i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred,P,Insignificant
a year and a half ago,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids,P,Insignificant
could you have done anything to avoid it,T,Insignificant
sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that,P,Insignificant
that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had,P,Insignificant
and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because,P,Insignificant
that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness,P,Insignificant
because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not,P,Insignificant
we do not have the highest,P,Insignificant
uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
that's a good one i would say,P,Insignificant
<laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that,P,Insignificant
and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i think i've done i'm i'm happy with my life thus far,P,Insignificant
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed,T,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
was giving a,P,Insignificant
rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing,P,Current Functional Status
and many of these people have never done it before,P,Insignificant
and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so,P,Insignificant
that was very gratifying to me,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
<deep breath>,P,Insignificant
i would say <sigh> my,P,Insignificant
devotion to,P,Insignificant
the environment,P,Insignificant
uh i wasn't always an environmentalist but uh,P,Insignificant
i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um,P,Insignificant
uh a steward,P,Insignificant
of the environment because today they're a lot of peoples people that are,P,Insignificant
polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic uh things like that and,P,Insignificant
i stand up and i uh have been on t_v and on uh youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment,P,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
you're welcome,P,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
goodbye,P,Insignificant
