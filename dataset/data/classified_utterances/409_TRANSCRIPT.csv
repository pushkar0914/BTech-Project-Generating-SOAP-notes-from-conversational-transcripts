uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas,P,Psychosocial History
i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh,P,Psychosocial History
it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it,P,Psychosocial History
but uh overall it's okay,P,Psychosocial History

uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
that's why that's my that was my major yeah,P,Psychosocial History
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh,P,Psychosocial History
it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the,P,Psychosocial History
in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um,P,Psychosocial History
you didn't see you know too many computers around back then,P,Psychosocial History
and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together,P,Psychosocial History
you know solving a,P,Insignificant
a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the,P,Insignificant
the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um,P,Insignificant
the problem,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
are you still working in that,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
why,T,Insignificant
um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
to the degree that i wanted to,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh,P,Insignificant
well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
fulfillment on but i don't wanna,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
relaxing job,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
yeah,T,Insignificant
yeah <laughter>,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
oh i would say,P,Insignificant
well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing,P,Psychosocial History
um but,P,Insignificant
i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more,P,Psychosocial History
vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much,P,Psychosocial History
like once the funny gates open up they kind of,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
open up too much so i have to like back off you know,P,Psychosocial History
(laughter,T,Insignificant
but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
oh really <laughter>,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
yeah <laughter>,P,Insignificant
oh um,P,Insignificant
well i listen to music um,P,Therapeutic Interventions
i'll um well i watch t_v um,P,Therapeutic Interventions
i'll um,P,Insignificant
just what what do i do to relax,P,Insignificant
well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too,P,Therapeutic Interventions
i'll be around an area,P,Insignificant
around,P,Insignificant
kind of a comfort area where i,P,Insignificant
i feel safe i can just,P,Insignificant
dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my,P,Insignificant
thinking about my own,P,Insignificant
problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus,P,Insignificant
on being in the moment with my um,P,Insignificant
acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances,P,Therapeutic Interventions
mm,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem,P,Risk Assessment
it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode,P,Risk Assessment
i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more,P,Risk Assessment
had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh,P,Risk Assessment
uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going,P,Risk Assessment
that's good,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
wow that's a good question,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm not sure to be honest um,P,Insignificant
i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that,P,Insignificant
it's not really part of my repertoire,P,Insignificant
um nothing comes to mind off top of my head,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
back about ten years ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i was more um,P,Insignificant
i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and um,P,Insignificant
i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and um unfortunately i made some bad,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that i really regret,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i see,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
wow,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
that's a tough one,P,Insignificant
i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
oh,P,Insignificant
well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um,P,Psychosocial History
it's just me and my uncle,P,Psychosocial History
and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um,P,Psychosocial History
he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida,P,Psychosocial History
so uh we're we're okay,P,Psychosocial History
but um,P,Insignificant
uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um,P,Psychosocial History
we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep,P,Psychosocial History
and uh he's got his own problems,P,Psychosocial History
so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation,P,Psychosocial History
and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have,P,Psychosocial History
so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel,P,Psychosocial History
i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem,P,Physiological Observations
and um,P,Insignificant
i have,P,Insignificant
a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom,P,Physiological Observations
and um,P,Insignificant
so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a,P,Insignificant
long story short <laughter>,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired,P,Physiological Observations
or achy,P,Physiological Observations
so it is it is difficult,P,Physiological Observations
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
uh <sigh>,P,Insignificant
well i've been feeling okay i mean um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
taken uh responsibility for,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but um,P,Insignificant
i feel a bit of calmness as of late,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that's good,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
mhm,T,Insignificant
the minnesota multifaceted,P,Insignificant
personality something of whether,P,Insignificant
this is going back about six months ago,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my,P,Insignificant
my well being psychologically too and i think some of the,P,Insignificant
the answers said that they,P,Insignificant
advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i didn't follow that,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
up on that because,P,Insignificant
of philosophical differences,P,Insignificant
but uh i think i might have a you know,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
a mild case of depression,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
why,T,Insignificant
well you know um,P,Insignificant
like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm doing okay but i you know i,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to,P,Psychosocial History
and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so um,P,Insignificant
you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
wow,P,Insignificant
that's a good one <laughter>,P,Insignificant
really happy um,P,Insignificant
let me think about that a minute,P,Insignificant
well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth>,P,Insignificant
okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer,P,Insignificant
um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow,P,Psychosocial History
it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh,P,Psychosocial History
we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters,P,Psychosocial History
giving out really nice samples,P,Psychosocial History
it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like,P,Psychosocial History
have me experience their product or service,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
i was around people that,P,Insignificant
i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh,P,Psychosocial History
i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh,P,Psychosocial History
about a month ago,P,Psychosocial History
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
yeah it was,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
best friend,P,Insignificant
i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh,P,Psychosocial History
i would say um,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh,P,Insignificant
i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>,P,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i i like to be conscientious i,P,Psychosocial History
you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall,P,Insignificant
i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know,P,Psychosocial History
say little white lies or you know,P,Insignificant
i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
i tend to be,P,Insignificant
pretty calm for the most part,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
what do i regret,P,Insignificant
well can you elaborate that <laughter>,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Insignificant
uh well um,P,Insignificant
i just well just overall um,P,Insignificant
i regret uh,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
not being a little more assertive in in my earlier,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh earlier life um,P,Insignificant
and kinda put myself in this position,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i made some bad decisions and unfortunately,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
sort of like,P,Insignificant
living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mm,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i think,P,Insignificant
i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i was kinda going away from,P,Insignificant
my basic,P,Insignificant
beingness you know like the way i really felt,P,Insignificant
like for example i'd make i would do aggressive,P,Insignificant
uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
well off for the rest of my life <laughter>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
but unfortunately it went the opposite way,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
too too many eggs in that basket,P,Insignificant
so i kinda regretted going with,P,Insignificant
my gut feeling and and let other people influence me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and uh,P,Insignificant
'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some,P,Insignificant
aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
right,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend,T,Insignificant
wow,P,Insignificant
that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter>,P,Insignificant
<laughter> well,P,Insignificant
i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually,P,Insignificant
you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows,P,Psychosocial History
but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um,P,Insignificant
you know i'd like to,P,Insignificant
go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game,P,Psychosocial History
uh go to a movie,P,Psychosocial History
go out with some friends,P,Psychosocial History
so i would just or you know just kinda kick back,P,Insignificant
but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on,P,Insignificant
you know earning earning money on the weekends,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
that's interesting,P,Insignificant
most proud of,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really,P,Psychosocial History
bad,P,Insignificant
bad uh,P,Insignificant
vice,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know i,P,Insignificant
i lived a pretty wholesome <wholeso> wholesome life i'd say that'd probably,P,Insignificant
i don't know if it's really proud um,P,Insignificant
but as but as far as i stayed the course as far as,P,Insignificant
uh not going down any real deep <laughter> alleys so to speak,P,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
my pleasure,P,Insignificant
