i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda ,P,Current Functional Status
got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while ,P,Current Functional Status
that sounds really hard ,T,Insignificant
uh sometimes ,P,Insignificant

are they triggered by something ,T,Insignificant
i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep,P,Physiological Observations
mhm,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant

quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious ,P,Psychosocial History
um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and,P,Psychosocial History

um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff ,P,Insignificant
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ,T,Insignificant
to just ,P,Insignificant
relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people,P,Psychosocial History
because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you,P,Insignificant
are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their ,P,Insignificant
their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just,P,Insignificant
believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be ,P,Insignificant
yeah ,T,Insignificant
yeah ,P,Insignificant
that makes sense ,T,Insignificant

um being the first to attend college in my family,P,Psychosocial History
and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so ,P,Psychosocial History
uh i'm most proud of being able to ,P,Insignificant
have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and,P,Insignificant
help someone else improve and better themself as well  ,P,Psychosocial History
that sounds like a great situation ,T,Insignificant
