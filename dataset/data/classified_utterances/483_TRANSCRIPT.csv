'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known,P,Insignificant
my my evil ex,P,Insignificant
um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five,P,Insignificant

don't trust her she can't be trusted,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um and more importantly,P,Insignificant

<deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
