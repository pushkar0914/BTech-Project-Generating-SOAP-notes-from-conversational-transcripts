"Well, I've been thinking a lot about the divorce and how I need to start looking for a job. It’s just a lot to handle.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a significant amount of stress. Have you made any progress on the job search?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Not really. I keep telling myself I need to start, but I just feel stuck. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It's understandable to feel stuck. Sometimes taking the first step can be the hardest. What do you think is holding you back?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I guess I’m afraid of failing. I haven't worked in years, and I don’t even know where to start.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Fear of failure is a common feeling, especially during transitions. What if we explored some potential job options together? ",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That might help. I just feel like I don’t have any skills anymore.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Those are valuable skills! Event planning requires organization and communication, which are highly sought after in many jobs. ",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I never thought of it that way. ,P,Insignificant

That could be interesting. I just worry that I won’t find anything.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What if we set a small goal for this week? Maybe you could look up a few local event planning companies or even volunteer for an event to get your feet wet.,T,Next Steps

"It’s been tough. I feel guilty for wanting to leave, even though I know it’s the right decision.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s common to feel guilt during a divorce, especially when children are involved. Have you been able to talk to your daughters about it?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Not really. I don’t want to upset them more than they already are.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s understandable to want to protect them. However, sometimes being honest about your feelings can help them process their own emotions. ",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I know, but I just don’t know how to approach the conversation.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
We can work on that together. What do you think would be important to convey to them?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I want them to know that I love them and that this is not their fault.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"I think they’ll be upset. They’ve seen us argue a bit, but I don’t think they fully understand.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
