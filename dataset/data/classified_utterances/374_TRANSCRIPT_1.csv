It’s completely normal to feel that way. Let’s explore that a bit more. What specific worries come up for you when you think about hearing back from potential employers?,T,Insignificant

Those thoughts can be really tough to deal with. Have you noticed any patterns in how you respond to those feelings of inadequacy?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I tend to shut down a bit. I’ll start second-guessing myself and then I don’t want to apply to more jobs.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds frustrating. What do you think might help you combat those feelings when they arise?,T,Insignificant
"I think reminding myself of my strengths could help. I mean, I’ve worked hard and have a lot of experience, but sometimes it just feels overshadowed by self-doubt.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a good realization. Would you be open to creating a list of your strengths and accomplishments to refer back to when those doubts creep in?,T,Therapeutic Interventions

"Yeah, I talked to my mom last week. It was nice to catch up.",P,Insignificant

"Just the usual stuff—how things are going with me and how she’s doing. She always asks about my job search, and I think she worries.",P,Psychosocial History
It sounds like she cares a lot about you. Do you feel supported by her during this time?,T,Insignificant
"Mostly, yeah. Sometimes I feel like she doesn’t quite understand the industry, but I appreciate her concern.",P,Psychosocial History
It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you thought about sharing more about your experiences with her to help her understand?,T,Insignificant
