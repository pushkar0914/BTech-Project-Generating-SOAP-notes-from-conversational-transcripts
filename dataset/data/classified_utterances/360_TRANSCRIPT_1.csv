Hi again! It’s great to see you back. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"I've been okay, just trying to keep busy with job searching.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s good to hear you’re keeping busy. Have you made any progress in your job search?  ,T,Insignificant
"A little bit, I applied to a couple of places but nothing back yet.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Job searching can take time. How do you feel about the process so far?  ,T,Insignificant
"It’s a bit frustrating, honestly. I just want to find something soon.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Frustration is a common feeling in job searching. Have you found any strategies that help you cope with that frustration?  ,T,Insignificant
I try to keep my mind off of it by watching TV or listening to music.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Those sound like good coping strategies. Have you considered setting small daily goals for your job search?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"I haven’t, but that sounds like a good idea.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
"It can help break things down into manageable steps. For example, you could aim to apply to one job a day or update your resume.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I think I could do that.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Great! Let’s check in on that next time. You mentioned feeling down sometimes. Can you tell me more about that?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Sometimes I just feel a bit lost, like I’m not sure what to do next.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That feeling of being lost can be tough. What do you think contributes to that feeling?  ,T,Insignificant
I think it’s just the uncertainty with my job situation and not knowing what’s next.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It makes sense that uncertainty would lead to feeling lost. Have you had any moments lately where you felt more grounded or certain?  ,T,Insignificant
I felt good when I was with my family for my birthday.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Yeah, they really are.  ",P,Insignificant
Have you been able to spend time with them since your birthday?  ,T,Insignificant
"Not much, just a quick call here and there.  ",P,Current Functional Status
Would you like to plan some time to see them soon?  ,T,Insignificant
I think that would be nice.  ,P,Insignificant
Let’s set a goal for you to reach out and plan something. How does that sound?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
Sounds good!  ,P,Insignificant
"Excellent! Now, you mentioned earlier about controlling your temper. Have there been any recent situations where you felt challenged?  ",T,Insignificant
"Not really, but I did feel a little annoyed at my fiancé about some small things.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s normal to feel annoyed sometimes. How did you handle those feelings?  ,T,Insignificant
I just tried to breathe and not let it get to me.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a great approach. Breathing exercises can be very effective. Would you like to learn some new techniques?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yes, I’d like that.  ",P,Insignificant
Okay! We can try a simple mindfulness technique today. It can help you feel more centered.  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds good.  ,P,Insignificant
