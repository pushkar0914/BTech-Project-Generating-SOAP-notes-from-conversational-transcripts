deal with stress and,P,Psychosocial History
it actually relaxes me even though i'm exercising,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and sometimes as an adult i still get angry,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
easily but i've gotten a lot better at,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
trying to think about things first before saying them and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
not having outbursts,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
things like that,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and she actually she has kids i don't,P,Insignificant
and for some reason she thought,P,Insignificant
or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and,P,Insignificant
she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things,P,Insignificant
um i don't think i've ever made her feel that,P,Insignificant
i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because,P,Insignificant
when she was talking to me she was very upset and,P,Insignificant
i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
hmm,T,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i felt that maybe i could've just let her,P,Insignificant
let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um instead of yelling at her too,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
oh wow um,P,Insignificant
that's a tough one i think um,P,Insignificant
gosh i think one of the toughest <tough> hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was,P,Insignificant
kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and,P,Insignificant
i kinda felt by ending the relationship um,P,Insignificant
i would've wasted those last seven years of my life,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
because then i went on to meet um,P,Insignificant
my husband,P,Insignificant
aw,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
um well about i would say,P,Insignificant
maybe,P,Insignificant
fifteen years ago i was,P,Insignificant
hanging out with a couple of friends at a,P,Insignificant
club,P,Insignificant
and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place,P,Insignificant
and i really didn't wanna go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it,P,Insignificant
but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
back at their house um,P,Insignificant
one of the guys,P,Insignificant
actually pulled me into a room and,P,Trauma History
tried,P,Trauma History
i i got scared i yelled,P,Trauma History
he tried to choke me and i thought,P,Trauma History
i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me,P,Trauma History
but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left,P,Trauma History
so,P,Insignificant
it could've been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind,P,Trauma History
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
it was,P,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
um we have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother,P,Psychosocial History
um my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older,P,Psychosocial History
and we get along pretty well,P,Psychosocial History
um my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then um now we're actually closer i think than ever,P,Psychosocial History
and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents,P,Psychosocial History
um my dad,P,Insignificant
still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes <laughter> which annoys me,P,Psychosocial History
(laughter,T,Insignificant
but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship,P,Psychosocial History
that's good,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um <sigh> i usually wake up,P,Physiological Observations
a few times throughout the night,P,Physiological Observations
um,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
i think it's rare for me to sleep,P,Physiological Observations
uh the whole night through ever,P,Insignificant
um and i do feel a little,P,Insignificant
like tired in the morning when i wake up it's hard i'm not a morning person definitely,P,Physiological Observations
um,P,Insignificant
so yeah it's kinda hard to get a good night's sleep,P,Physiological Observations
why,T,Insignificant
um i don't know it,P,Insignificant
i have a hard time falling asleep,P,Physiological Observations
and then sometimes i have bad dreams or,P,Physiological Observations
i need to get up to use the restroom um,P,Insignificant
but yeah it,P,Insignificant
i don't remember the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once,P,Physiological Observations

um,P,Insignificant
emotionally good,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um i'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant

makes me feel,P,Insignificant
bad um 'cause i like working out,P,Insignificant

we really enjoyed ourselves um we went wine tasting and,P,Psychosocial History
went to the beach and just had a really good time,P,Psychosocial History

um she would probably describe me as a good caring person,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
patient,P,Psychosocial History
very shy,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
she'd probably say too that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors 'cause i'm always doing things for other people,P,Psychosocial History
um so yeah that's how i think she would describe me,P,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant

um,P,Insignificant
i wish that,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
what else,P,Insignificant
definitely more outgoing,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
so i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i am very shy,P,Psychosocial History
um i also wish that i could have more patience than i do <laughter> sometimes i'm very short of patience,P,Psychosocial History
and um i wish i could,P,Insignificant
find a better job so i could do more traveling,P,Psychosocial History

you know taken care of it a lot sooner than i did,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
um i would've told myself to stay focused on school that,P,Insignificant
going out and hanging out and just,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
and going to parties um was not as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first,P,Psychosocial History
