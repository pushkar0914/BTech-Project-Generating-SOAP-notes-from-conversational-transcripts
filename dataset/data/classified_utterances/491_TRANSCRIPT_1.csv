I'm glad to hear you were able to manage. How did you cope during that time?,T,Insignificant
I leaned on my friends a lot. They were really supportive. Just being there made a difference.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That's wonderful. Having a support system is so important. Did you find any particular coping strategies helpful during the funeral?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I tried to focus on the good memories rather than the sadness. It helped to talk about the happy times we had.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a healthy approach. Reflecting on positive memories can be comforting. How have you felt since then?,T,Insignificant
"Honestly, a bit drained. I think it’s hitting me more now that the event is over. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

Balancing school and personal life can be challenging. What are you currently focusing on in your studies?,T,Insignificant
"We're working on family law right now, which is interesting but also heavy.",P,Current Functional Status

"It’s tough sometimes. I find myself getting really invested in the cases we discuss, especially the ones involving children.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. It shows you care about the impact of your future work. Do you think this emotional investment affects your well-being?,T,Insignificant
"Definitely. I sometimes take those stories home with me, and it can be overwhelming.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Have you considered any strategies to help separate your studies from your personal life?,T,Insignificant

A little lighter. I think I could use this more often.,P,Mental Health Observations
