Hi there! Welcome back! How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"Hey, Ellie. I’ve had some ups and downs, but I’ve been trying to stick to the goals we set.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s great to hear! How did the breathing exercises go for you?  ,T,Insignificant
"I actually used them a few times when I felt stressed, and it helped.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
Wonderful! I’m glad you found them useful. How about your bedtime goal? Were you able to stick to it?  ,T,Insignificant
"I managed to get to bed by midnight a few nights, but I still slipped back into my old habits a couple of times.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s okay! Change takes time. What do you think made it difficult to stick to the bedtime?  ,T,Insignificant
I got caught up in playing poker online again.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s easy to lose track of time with activities we enjoy. Perhaps we can brainstorm some strategies to help you balance your interests with your sleep goals.  ,T,Insignificant
That would be helpful.  ,P,Insignificant
One idea could be to set a timer for yourself while you play. Would you be willing to try that?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I can try setting a timer.  ",P,Next Steps
Great! And how has your mood been overall? Any changes since we last spoke?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve had some good days, but I still feel moody at times.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s perfectly normal to have fluctuations in mood. Have you noticed any specific triggers for those mood swings?  ,T,Insignificant
"Stress, mostly. And sometimes just feeling lonely.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Loneliness can be tough. Have you thought about reaching out to friends or engaging in social activities?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been thinking about it. I don’t have a big circle, though.  ",P,Psychosocial History
That’s understandable. Even small interactions can make a difference. Would you consider joining a local poker club or a group related to your hobbies?  ,T,Next Steps
That could be interesting. I’ve never really thought about it.  ,P,Insignificant
"It might be a good way to meet new people who share your interests. Plus, it could help combat feelings of loneliness.  ",T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I think I’ll look into that.  ",P,Next Steps
"Awesome! Now, last time we discussed boundaries with your parents. Have you had a chance to reflect on that?  ",T,Insignificant
I thought about it a bit. I think I need to distance myself more to protect my mental health.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a healthy realization. Setting boundaries can be empowering. How do you envision those boundaries?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I’ll limit contact and not engage in conversations that lead to conflict.  ,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a solid plan. It’s important to prioritize your well-being. How do you feel about taking that step?  ,T,Insignificant
"A little nervous, but I think it’s necessary.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s completely valid. It’s natural to feel apprehensive about change. Would you like to role-play a scenario where you set a boundary?  ,T,Insignificant
"Sure, that could help.  ",P,Insignificant
"Okay, imagine a situation where your parents reach out to you. How would you respond?  ",T,Insignificant
"I’d say something like, “I’m not in a good place to talk right now.”  ",P,Next Steps
That’s a good start! It’s direct and sets the tone. Would you like to add anything else?  ,T,Insignificant
"Maybe I could say, “Let’s talk later when I’m feeling better.”  ",P,Next Steps
Perfect! That keeps the door open while prioritizing your feelings. How does that feel to say?  ,T,Insignificant
It feels empowering.  ,P,Insignificant
"I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to prioritize your needs. Is there anything else you’d like to work on today?  ",T,Insignificant
I think we covered a lot.  ,P,Insignificant
"Great! So to recap, you’ll try setting a timer for your poker sessions, look into joining a local club, and work on setting boundaries with your parents. Sound good?  ",T,Insignificant
"Yes, that sounds good!  ",P,Insignificant
Wonderful! I look forward to hearing how everything goes next time. Take care!  ,T,Insignificant
"Thanks, Ellie. Bye!  ",P,Insignificant
Bye!,T,Insignificant
