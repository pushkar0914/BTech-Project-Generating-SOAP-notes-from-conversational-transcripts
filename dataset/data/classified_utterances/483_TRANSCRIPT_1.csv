<sigh>  ,P,Insignificant
Hi again! It’s great to see you back. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"Uh, not too bad, I guess. Just the usual ups and downs.  ",P,Insignificant
"I’m glad to hear that. Last time, we talked a lot about your experiences with Katrina and your ex. Have you had any thoughts about those topics since we last spoke?  ",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, I’ve thought about it a bit. I mean, it’s hard not to, right?  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Absolutely. It’s a big part of your life. Did anything in particular stand out to you?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I guess I realized how much those experiences shaped me. Like, I’m still dealing with the aftermath of both.  ",P,Trauma History
That’s a powerful insight. How do you feel those experiences have shaped your daily life now?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Well, with Katrina, I think I’m more anxious about things that could happen. Like, I always feel like I need to be prepared for the worst.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. It sounds like a survival instinct. How does that anxiety manifest for you?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I get really restless and sometimes paranoid. Like, I’ll check the news constantly about weather or earthquakes.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Risk Assessment
That sounds exhausting. Have you found any strategies that help you cope with that anxiety?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Not really. I mean, I try to distract myself with video games or books, but sometimes it just doesn’t work.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Distraction can be helpful, but it sounds like you might need some additional coping strategies. Would you be open to exploring some techniques together?  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, I’m willing to try anything at this point.  ",P,Insignificant
Great! One technique we can try is mindfulness. It helps ground you in the present moment. Have you ever practiced mindfulness before?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Not really. I’ve heard about it, but I don’t know how to do it.  ",P,Insignificant
That’s okay! We can start simple. Let’s take a moment to focus on your breathing. Just inhale deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth.  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
<deep breath> Okay.  ,P,Insignificant
"Good. As you breathe, try to notice how your body feels. Are there any areas of tension?  ",T,Mental Health Observations
I feel tightness in my shoulders.  ,P,Mental Health Observations
"Acknowledge that tension. With each breath, imagine it releasing. Inhale calm, exhale tension.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"<sigh> Okay, I think I’m getting it.  ",P,Insignificant
Excellent. Mindfulness can be a great tool for managing anxiety. How do you feel now after practicing that for a moment?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I feel a little lighter, actually.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful to hear! Would you like to incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine?  ,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I think I could do that. It might help with the anxiety.  ",P,Next Steps
"Absolutely! It’s all about finding what works for you. Speaking of routines, how have you been sleeping lately?  ",T,Physiological Observations
"Not great. I still feel like I’m sleeping too much, but I’m also tired a lot.  ",P,Physiological Observations
It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle of fatigue. Have you noticed any triggers that affect your sleep?  ,T,Physiological Observations
"Sometimes it’s just my mind racing with thoughts. Other times, it’s just that I feel so drained from everything.  ",P,Physiological Observations
That’s understandable. Have you tried any techniques to calm your mind before bed?  ,T,Next Steps
Not really. I usually just scroll through my phone until I pass out.  ,P,Insignificant
"That’s common, but it can actually disrupt your sleep. Would you be interested in exploring some bedtime routines?  ",T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I’m open to that.  ",P,Insignificant
"Great! One technique is to create a wind-down routine. This could include reading a book, listening to calming music, or practicing relaxation exercises.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Okay, I can try that. I do like reading.  ",P,Next Steps
Perfect! Let’s set a goal for you to try this routine for a week and see how it affects your sleep. How does that sound?  ,T,Next Steps
Sounds good! I’ll give it a shot.  ,P,Next Steps
"Awesome! And remember, be gentle with yourself. It’s all about progress, not perfection.  ",T,Insignificant
"Right, I’ll keep that in mind.  ",P,Insignificant
Is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss today?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I want to talk about my temper again. I’ve noticed I’ve been getting angry more easily lately.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s important to address. What do you think is triggering that anger?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I think it’s just frustration from everything. Like, I feel stuck in my life and it just bubbles over sometimes.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Feeling stuck can be really challenging. Have you thought about what you’d like to change in your life?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, I want to find a job that I actually enjoy, but I’m not sure what that is.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great goal. Exploring your interests and passions can help you find that path. What do you enjoy doing?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I like drawing and creating things, but I don’t know how to turn that into a job.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a start! Have you considered looking into fields that combine your interests, like graphic design or animation?  ",T,Next Steps
"I’ve thought about it, but I feel like I’d be starting from scratch.  ",P,Insignificant
"Starting from scratch can feel daunting, but remember, every expert was once a beginner. What if we set a goal for you to explore some options in those fields?  ",T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I could do that. Maybe I’ll look into some classes or online tutorials.  ",P,Next Steps
That sounds like a fantastic plan! Let’s aim for you to research at least one option this week.  ,T,Next Steps
"Okay, I can do that.  ",P,Insignificant
"Great! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about our session?  ",T,Insignificant
"I feel good. I think I have some things to work on, but it’s manageable.  ",P,Insignificant
"I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you’re not alone in this process. I’m here to support you.  ",T,Insignificant
"Thanks, Ellie. I appreciate it.  ",P,Insignificant
