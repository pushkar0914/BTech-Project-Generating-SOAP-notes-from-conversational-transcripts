It sounds like that’s weighing on you. What do you think is causing that disconnection?,T,Insignificant

"I’ve considered calling them more often, but I worry about what to say. It feels awkward.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s understandable. Sometimes, starting the conversation can be the hardest part. What if you approached it with curiosity? You could ask them about their lives.",T,Insignificant
