yeah,T,Insignificant
trying to,P,Insignificant
you know say you know what's this what's this,P,Insignificant
uh it was very humbling,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant

mhm,T,Insignificant

um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction,P,Psychosocial History
i've also studied uh computer networking,P,Psychosocial History
cool,T,Insignificant
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it was,P,Insignificant
i guess,P,Insignificant
just uh kinda circumstances,P,Insignificant
i needed,P,Insignificant
the,P,Insignificant
the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family,P,Psychosocial History
and,P,Insignificant
i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain,P,Psychosocial History
are you happy you did that,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
uh it's given me a lot of opportunity,P,Psychosocial History
but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary,P,Psychosocial History
uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall,P,Psychosocial History
uh for four years,P,Psychosocial History
and last year we we trained in north carolina,P,Psychosocial History
for one year,P,Psychosocial History
um and that was like theology and bible training,P,Psychosocial History
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
basically god put,P,Insignificant
a um,P,Insignificant
a desire in my heart to get beyond,P,Insignificant
get beyond myself and and do something for other people,P,Insignificant
to to go and,P,Insignificant
and learn about another people their culture,P,Psychosocial History
and to share the gospel with them,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
well in my immediate family,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters,P,Psychosocial History
and then um,P,Insignificant
but i i have one older brother,P,Psychosocial History
uh no sisters,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
so what what do you wanna know about my family,P,Insignificant
how close are you to your family,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm really close with my wife and my daughters,P,Psychosocial History
uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped,P,Psychosocial History
um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
even though he's he's five years older than me,P,Insignificant
so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him,P,Psychosocial History
but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents,P,Psychosocial History
i see,T,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'd say my,P,Insignificant
my youth pastor in high school,P,Psychosocial History
he was a real real positive influence in me,P,Psychosocial History
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
just he has a,P,Insignificant
he has a drive and a zeal for,P,Insignificant
for pursuing the truth,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and just uh,P,Insignificant
studying the bible and,P,Insignificant
and because of his influence that kinda,P,Insignificant
put me on a path to wanting to study the bible,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um i think i've gotten better at it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
there have been,P,Insignificant
times when,P,Insignificant
you know i'll i'll get angry,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and uh,P,Insignificant
you know it can just,P,Insignificant
kinda really rule over me just the frustration,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i'm the type of person that it takes me,P,Insignificant
um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to,P,Insignificant
to calm down again,P,Insignificant
but i've,P,Insignificant
i've learned um,P,Insignificant
over time that really getting angry,P,Insignificant
um and keeping that anger in doesn't,P,Insignificant
it doesn't,P,Insignificant
attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
to keep so,P,Insignificant
when <whe> when things anger me i try to,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and and resolve it and come to a resolution,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
well a,P,Insignificant
a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents,P,Psychosocial History
and her parents had already left,P,Insignificant
um eh we were just driving down to,P,Insignificant
orange country area for this trip,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and,P,Insignificant
but hadn't really,P,Insignificant
in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had,P,Insignificant
and so,P,Insignificant
when i was trying to meet those expectations,P,Insignificant
she,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um and kinda getting attacked for it,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
so then i i i started yelling at her,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and we you know we had that conflict but then,P,Insignificant
you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through,P,Insignificant
and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
are you asking the moment of during the conflict,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
in your body,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
part partly i,P,Insignificant
the i guess the,P,Insignificant
anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mm,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
i would think um,P,Insignificant
yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
mm hmm hmm hmm,P,Insignificant
i guess it was um,P,Insignificant
deciding to go,P,Insignificant
um to go to our training last year,P,Insignificant
um i i felt that god had put on my heart that,P,Insignificant
that this was something i was supposed to pursue,P,Insignificant
um my wife didn't feel that way,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it,P,Insignificant
um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um,P,Insignificant
you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going,P,Insignificant
uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh,P,Insignificant
you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
but then after i kinda gave that up,P,Insignificant
then,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so,P,Insignificant
um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
oh let me see,P,Insignificant
i'm not sure um,P,Insignificant
i don't know i i can't really,P,Insignificant
think of anything very traumatic,P,Trauma History
um that i would wanna erase but i i think,P,Insignificant
you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda,P,Insignificant
shape who we are,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um usually,P,Insignificant

so,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
coming home in the morning,P,Insignificant
you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep,P,Physiological Observations
but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i understand,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
uh it pretty easy,P,Physiological Observations

um usually my my friend i end up doing,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
different work around the house for him,P,Psychosocial History

mhm,T,Insignificant

um,P,Insignificant
start conversations with people,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
easier,P,Insignificant
uh sometimes,P,Insignificant
i have i have trouble,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
just talking to people,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but kinda talking to people in a group,P,Insignificant
uh i wish i was a little better at that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh,P,Insignificant
advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
