what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so,P,Psychosocial History
my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was,P,Insignificant
um being on a bus and and leaving,P,Insignificant
um dublin and going just out to the countryside and,P,Insignificant
seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but,P,Insignificant

not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and,P,Psychosocial History
um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother,P,Psychosocial History

how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
<mutters>,P,Insignificant
well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant

sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance,P,Current Functional Status
i love to read,P,Current Functional Status
i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions,P,Current Functional Status
that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else,P,Current Functional Status
um,P,Insignificant
i like to be with friends um,P,Current Functional Status
i love art and,P,Current Functional Status
trying new restaurants um,P,Current Functional Status
yeah all those things are,P,Insignificant
both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that,P,Insignificant
um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so,P,Current Functional Status
uh huh,T,Insignificant
yeah yeah,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>,P,Current Functional Status
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be,P,Insignificant
oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery,P,Insignificant
yeah that was the last time so,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of,P,Current Functional Status
uh it didn't show up,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until,P,Insignificant
um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and,P,Insignificant
they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place,P,Insignificant
so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that,P,Insignificant
the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so,P,Insignificant
i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated,P,Current Functional Status
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um,P,Insignificant
let me think about one,P,Insignificant
um the other day i had a phone call,P,Insignificant
and i'm in a coaching program and,P,Insignificant
it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program,P,Insignificant
and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with,P,Insignificant
and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
someone who's not my coach and uh that,P,Insignificant
hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these,P,Insignificant
people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to,P,Insignificant
not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
yeah i wasn't um,P,Insignificant
i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and,P,Insignificant
it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
yeah i could've,P,Insignificant
certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and,P,Insignificant
would've made the call go a lot smoother,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few,P,Insignificant
i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision,P,Psychosocial History
no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was,P,Psychosocial History
challenging,P,Insignificant
um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i,P,Insignificant
moved,P,Insignificant
uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado,P,Psychosocial History
and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been,P,Insignificant
you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know,P,Insignificant
um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging,P,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
oh lots of things um,P,Insignificant
i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and,P,Insignificant
the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um,P,Insignificant
at the time i was very much into rock climbing,P,Insignificant
and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were,P,Insignificant
um in my age group and or single that was another factor um,P,Insignificant
and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit,P,Psychosocial History
so,P,Insignificant
yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but,P,Insignificant
um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move,P,Psychosocial History
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Physiological Observations
uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
relatively easily,P,Physiological Observations
it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then,P,Physiological Observations
you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today,P,Physiological Observations
but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty,P,Physiological Observations
anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily,P,Physiological Observations
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah and i just i have to find,P,Insignificant
the financial means to support me in doing that and it's,P,Insignificant
and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i see,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and mm my money's not working at all,P,Insignificant
so yeah it feels pretty crappy,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
<laughter> thanks,P,Insignificant

i have in the past yeah,P,Medical and Psychiatric History

what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
i was suicidal,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
do you feel down,T,Insignificant
oh yeah i feel down mhm,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
do you still go to therapy now,T,Insignificant
i don't actually no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
why did you stop,T,Insignificant
why did you stop,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i originally stopped,P,Insignificant
with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had,P,Insignificant
worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and um and then i began therapy again,P,Insignificant
later on,P,Insignificant
think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties,P,Insignificant
um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Insignificant
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Insignificant
yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous,P,Therapeutic Interventions
right,T,Insignificant
i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see,P,Therapeutic Interventions
and,P,Insignificant
you know work through that situation and come up with um,P,Therapeutic Interventions
a strategy for,P,Therapeutic Interventions
not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies,P,Therapeutic Interventions
and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever,P,Therapeutic Interventions
