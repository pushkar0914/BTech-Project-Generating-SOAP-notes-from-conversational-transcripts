"<sigh> hey, Ellie. ",P,Insignificant
Hi! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"I've been good, just busy with work and family stuff.",P,Psychosocial History
"That's understandable. Last time, you mentioned being really close with your family. How has that been for you lately?",T,Insignificant
"Well, my mom and I have been talking a lot more. I think she’s feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything going on.",P,Psychosocial History
How do you feel about that? ,T,Insignificant
"I feel like I need to be there for her. I want to help, but sometimes I don't know how.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a lot of pressure. What do you think would help you both in that situation?,T,Insignificant
Maybe just listening more. I think she needs someone to vent to.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That's a great insight. Listening can be very powerful. Have you had a chance to do that yet?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I sat down with her last weekend. We talked for a few hours. It felt good.",P,Current Functional Status
That's wonderful! How did it feel for you to be that support for her?,T,Insignificant
"It felt rewarding, but I also felt a bit drained afterward. Like, I took on some of her stress.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Mental Health Observations
It's natural to feel that way when we care about someone. How do you usually cope with those feelings of being drained?,T,Insignificant
I try to recharge by listening to music or going for a walk. ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Those sound like effective strategies. Have you had a chance to use them lately?,T,Insignificant
I went for a walk after our talk. It helped clear my head.,P,Current Functional Status
"Good! It's important to take care of yourself too. Speaking of self-care, you mentioned wanting to be more in touch with your emotions last time. How's that going?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to reflect more on how I feel, especially when I’m with my family. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great step. Have you noticed any specific emotions coming up?,T,Insignificant
"Sometimes I feel frustrated, especially when my dad is involved. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Can you tell me more about that?,T,Insignificant
"Well, he still has a way of dismissing my opinions. It frustrates me because I want him to listen.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like that dynamic is challenging for you. How do you usually handle those feelings of frustration?,T,Insignificant
I usually just keep quiet. I don’t want to argue.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. But holding back can sometimes lead to more frustration. Have you thought about expressing how you feel to him?,T,Insignificant
"I have, but I worry it’ll turn into an argument.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a valid concern. It might help to approach it gently, perhaps by expressing your feelings rather than making accusations. ",T,Insignificant
I could try that. ,P,Insignificant
It might also be helpful to set a time to talk when both of you are calm. Would that be something you’d consider?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I could do that.",P,Insignificant
Great! What would be your goal for that conversation?,T,Insignificant
I just want him to understand my perspective. ,P,Next Steps
"That’s a solid goal. Remember, it’s about sharing your feelings, not necessarily changing his mind.",T,Insignificant
"Right, I get that.",P,Insignificant
How do you feel about the idea of journaling your thoughts before the conversation? It might help you clarify what you want to say.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds like a good idea. I can organize my thoughts better that way.,P,Next Steps
Perfect! Let’s plan to discuss how that conversation goes in our next session. ,T,Next Steps
Sounds good. ,P,Insignificant
Is there anything else on your mind today?,T,Insignificant

I just feel like I’m not doing enough to help people right now.,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
It’s great that you have that desire to help others. Have you considered ways you could start doing that in your current role?,T,Insignificant
I could mentor some of my coworkers. ,P,Next Steps
That’s a fantastic idea! Mentoring can be a great way to share your knowledge and support others.,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I’ll reach out to a few people.",P,Next Steps
Wonderful! How does that feel for you?,T,Insignificant
It feels good. I just hope they’re open to it.,P,Insignificant

"Before we wrap up, is there anything you want to set as a goal for next week?",T,Insignificant
