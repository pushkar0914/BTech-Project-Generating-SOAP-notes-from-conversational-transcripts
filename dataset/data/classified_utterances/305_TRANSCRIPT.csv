if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
and so,P,Insignificant
you know um,P,Insignificant
i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about,P,Insignificant
you know um money um,P,Insignificant
you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or,P,Insignificant
mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that ,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
how do i what,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
how do i cope with them,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i just,P,Insignificant
try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um,P,Insignificant
i just do it's uh,P,Insignificant
i'm more of a guy that just,P,Insignificant
you know it may take me a moment to,P,Insignificant
to um,P,Insignificant
say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mm,T,Insignificant
uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um,P,Insignificant
back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
if what has gotten me in trouble,P,Insignificant
my mood swing i mean,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
on uh how to interview how to uh,P,Insignificant
how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh,P,Insignificant
i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who ,P,Insignificant
who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done ,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i've done uh,P,Insignificant
i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and try to uh work on,P,Insignificant
the issues that were bothering me so um,P,Insignificant
you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and uh,P,Insignificant
anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mhm,T,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Insignificant
pardon me,P,Insignificant
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Insignificant
i still didn't hear you,P,Insignificant
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Insignificant
that,P,Insignificant
people have been deceitful,P,Insignificant
can you repeat that one more time,P,Insignificant
why don't we talk about that later,T,Insignificant
alright,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it's tough if you don't you know um,P,Insignificant
i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
you know,P,Insignificant
some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so i just try to cope with things uh,P,Insignificant
um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um,P,Insignificant
whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it  ,P,Insignificant
um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still ,P,Insignificant
uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people,P,Insignificant
um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um,P,Insignificant
you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus,P,Insignificant
that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way ,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
so i just let it go,P,Insignificant
i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad ,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
did you think you had a problem before you found out,T,Insignificant
did i have a problem before i got out,P,Insignificant
did you think you had a problem before you found out,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people ,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older,P,Insignificant
kind of uh,P,Insignificant
you know makes it work you know,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
me me dealing with life so,P,Insignificant
how has seeing a therapist affected you,T,Insignificant
pardon me,P,Insignificant
how has seeing a therapist affected you,T,Insignificant
uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh recently,P,Insignificant
and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
a lot of people may not understand that but uh,P,Insignificant
a therapist is,P,Insignificant
i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh,P,Insignificant
people you know uh,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like,P,Insignificant
you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others,P,Insignificant
uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who,P,Insignificant
will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
but it's good to have,P,Insignificant
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
