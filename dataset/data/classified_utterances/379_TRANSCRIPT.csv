that's great,T,Insignificant
yep,P,Insignificant
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yeah,T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant

uh huh,T,Insignificant
yep,P,Insignificant
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting,P,Psychosocial History

like i said i'm twenty three years old,P,Psychosocial History
um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but,P,Psychosocial History
for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so,P,Psychosocial History
things are uh you know,P,Insignificant
getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well,P,Psychosocial History
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle,P,Insignificant
you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back,P,Insignificant
other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but,P,Insignificant
you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before,P,Insignificant
so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know,P,Insignificant
i can either be talk very talkative,P,Insignificant
or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
um you know usually um,P,Insignificant
i would listen to music,P,Psychosocial History
or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive,P,Psychosocial History
or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know,P,Psychosocial History
ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy,P,Psychosocial History
so,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
you know i've actually been better with that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um couple years back you know i,P,Insignificant
there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but,P,Insignificant
you know it's it's always something so miniscule that,P,Insignificant
that's why i probably don't remember it,P,Insignificant
but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that,P,Insignificant
you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
something that i feel guilty about,P,Insignificant
um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent,P,Insignificant
kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got,P,Insignificant
diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
he could be a little you know,P,Insignificant
crazy,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back,P,Insignificant
been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old,P,Psychosocial History
aw,T,Insignificant
so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to,P,Insignificant
i don't i don't  you know,P,Insignificant
try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah,P,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
my best friend,P,Insignificant
<laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy,P,Insignificant
usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too,P,Insignificant
um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny,P,Insignificant
um i like to hang out you know just,P,Insignificant
kinda,P,Insignificant
do things here and there you know just,P,Insignificant
normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
<clears throat,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep,P,Physiological Observations
i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know,P,Physiological Observations
my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough,P,Physiological Observations
so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part,P,Physiological Observations
i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat>,P,Physiological Observations
okay,T,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
lately eh,P,Insignificant
been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but,P,Insignificant
you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
i have not,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant

tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still,P,Insignificant
still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave,P,Insignificant
so you know we were just hanging out,P,Insignificant
um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so,P,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
i felt great you know it,P,Insignificant
because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything,P,Insignificant
can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like,P,Insignificant
that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that took place,P,Insignificant
so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said,P,Insignificant
it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way,P,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
well you know it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a child then so i i really don't know what to say i mean even if,P,Insignificant
i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just,P,Insignificant
be careful you know,P,Insignificant
make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
basically you know just always be nice be honest,P,Insignificant
um just be caring toward others so,P,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing,P,Insignificant
i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so,P,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend,T,Insignificant
my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends,P,Psychosocial History
um either you know we hang out in the day,P,Psychosocial History
you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers,P,Psychosocial History
um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so,P,Psychosocial History
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
some things that i wish i could change,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
probably just you know be nicer like i said before,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
maybe not being as lazy have more determination,P,Insignificant
i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life,P,Insignificant
but i know there are times when i i kinda,P,Insignificant
get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself,T,Insignificant
um well you know it's it's tough to think back,P,Insignificant
but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know,P,Insignificant
i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have,P,Insignificant
i was trying to give more constructive criticism but,P,Insignificant
at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and,P,Insignificant
they were out of character so,P,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined,P,Insignificant

um you know it was probably <sigh> over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're gonna go into the paper so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i feel accomplished about that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there,P,Insignificant
you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
