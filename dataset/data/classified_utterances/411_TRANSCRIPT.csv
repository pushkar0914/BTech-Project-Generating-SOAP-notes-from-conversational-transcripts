so how are you doing today,T,Insignificant
pretty good,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
where are you from originally,T,Insignificant
new york,P,Psychosocial History
really,T,Insignificant
when did you move to l_a,T,Insignificant
uh i moved to l_a in the seventies,P,Psychosocial History
that's a long time,T,Insignificant
but i yeah but i lived a lot of different places,P,Psychosocial History
how often do you go back to your hometown,T,Insignificant
of,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i guess every few years but,P,Psychosocial History
i travel a lot so i've lived in,P,Psychosocial History
i've lived in africa i've lived in spain switzerland hong kong too,P,Psychosocial History
wow,T,Insignificant
what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
um different cultures food music rituals,P,Psychosocial History
uh,P,Insignificant
everything the smells the colors,P,Psychosocial History
makes you feel alive,P,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
excuse me,P,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
one of my trips,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
uh i lived in kenya for about a year um i'd say,P,Psychosocial History
i love horseback riding so when you're,P,Insignificant
uh viewing other animals when you're,P,Insignificant
kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so um it was great,P,Insignificant
seeing red orange fall sunsets and,P,Insignificant
riding along you know uh,P,Insignificant
seeing so many animals yeah,P,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
in kenya um,P,Insignificant
probably when i went to a,P,Insignificant
a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii,P,Psychosocial History
and i've had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it,P,Insignificant
tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to,P,Insignificant
enter a masai village for the first time,P,Insignificant
uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same,P,Insignificant
twist <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
and uh <laughter> and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they would've like weighed,P,Insignificant
my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets,P,Insignificant
and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai <laughter> so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living,P,Insignificant
aw,T,Insignificant
getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i've just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen,P,Psychosocial History
uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go,P,Psychosocial History
achieve it sometimes um i believe that,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
usually i well i make decisions very quickly,P,Psychosocial History
and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker,P,Insignificant
and i told him i said well in each case,P,Insignificant
you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's,P,Insignificant
hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one,P,Insignificant
and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy,P,Insignificant
mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure,P,Insignificant
even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time,P,Insignificant
and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
uh pardon,P,Insignificant
you said you put your fish,P,Insignificant
what do you do when you are annoyed,T,Insignificant
what do i do when i'm annoyed,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
<tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um,P,Psychosocial History
i guess you really have to put yourself,P,Insignificant
in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy,P,Psychosocial History
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're,P,Psychosocial History
put in other situations where you're forced to,P,Insignificant
to um,P,Insignificant
understand other people's,P,Insignificant
lives a lot more regardless of how different they are,P,Psychosocial History
uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why,P,Psychosocial History
travel is really the best education there is,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
<sigh> let me think um,P,Insignificant
<tisk> uh <sigh>,P,Insignificant
last time i argued about,P,Insignificant
something um,P,Insignificant
god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um,P,Insignificant
oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something,P,Psychosocial History
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
uh <sigh>,P,Insignificant
oh i know what it was um,P,Insignificant
it was somebody who belonged to the uh,P,Insignificant
uh scientology faith um,P,Insignificant
i uh,P,Insignificant
inherited,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and um,P,Insignificant
uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and um,P,Insignificant
<tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
and he said something about are you aware of,P,Insignificant
past lives and,P,Insignificant
i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that,P,Insignificant
if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and i and he said that are you aware that,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
<tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that,P,Insignificant
many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have,P,Insignificant
had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness,P,Insignificant
um resulting from even your past relationships or your,P,Insignificant
parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that,P,Insignificant
you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself,P,Insignificant
even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold,P,Insignificant
maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge,P,Insignificant
i take,P,Insignificant
sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would,P,Insignificant
fold down i had my boo boo,P,Insignificant
and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part,P,Insignificant
you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
and i would actually,P,Insignificant
even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital,P,Insignificant
the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that,P,Insignificant
just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that,P,Insignificant
because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and,P,Insignificant
it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was,P,Insignificant
um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen,P,Insignificant
twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have,P,Insignificant
never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of,P,Insignificant
somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
uh the following week,P,Insignificant
and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get,P,Insignificant
into it but,P,Insignificant
one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused,P,Insignificant
by people themselves,P,Insignificant
and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that,P,Insignificant
past lives can also affect,P,Insignificant
you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are,P,Insignificant
are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought,P,Insignificant
he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so,P,Insignificant
but um,P,Insignificant
<tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't,P,Insignificant
you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
but other than that i mean i don't,P,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
<sigh> um,P,Insignificant
uh <sigh>,P,Insignificant
sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when,P,Insignificant
when it's in terms of patience,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
mm <sigh>,P,Insignificant
mm my brother,P,Insignificant
uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he,P,Insignificant
is in the medical field so my sister and i said well,P,Insignificant
you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time,P,Insignificant
but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after,P,Insignificant
you know my boss my father kept,P,Insignificant
you know um,P,Insignificant
um you know bucking the his body would actually,P,Insignificant
be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard,P,Insignificant
mm but you know it was after a while the uh,P,Insignificant
you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular,P,Insignificant
uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would've been <b> been you know negligible,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
yeah it was mhm,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
hm,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic,P,Trauma History
that happened to me that i've,P,Insignificant
had to block them i really don't know what,P,Insignificant
it is within my makeup which,P,Insignificant
doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep i have friends that,P,Insignificant
have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of,P,Insignificant
that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear,P,Insignificant
and for some reason i i feel blessed that i,P,Insignificant
don't really i can't really even think of something that,P,Insignificant
i mean i've had some,P,Insignificant
bad situations happen to me but,P,Insignificant
it's not that the some reason they've traumatized me,P,Insignificant
in affecting,P,Insignificant
you know my behavior where i would,P,Insignificant
where i block it that i'm not aware,P,Insignificant
of something or i hold residual,P,Insignificant
negativity for some reason so,P,Insignificant
i really can't think of anything i mean,P,Insignificant
there's bad things that happen and i know they're there but it's not like i feel like i it's necessary for me to,P,Insignificant
block them 'cause i've been able to,P,Insignificant
you know um,P,Insignificant
accept sometimes <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just,P,Physiological Observations
kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so,P,Physiological Observations
i can just <j> i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but,P,Physiological Observations
say like if i'm in africa and i,P,Insignificant
<tisk> bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my,P,Insignificant
elbow against the window and say i think i'll gonna take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have <ha> have that problem,P,Physiological Observations
(laughter,T,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that i'm in pretty good spirts uh huh,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
have i ever studied <s> studied what,P,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
uh i could still couldn't hear you i'm sorry,P,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
have i ever studied changes <ch> changes in my behavior what was the word,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
um no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
uh uh,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
um <sigh> i don't know just with friends and everything just even this,P,Insignificant
past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having a great meal laughing just you know having a good time listening to music,P,Psychosocial History
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
you know it's funny,P,Insignificant
uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
opened up experiences that are,P,Insignificant
that are also great that i have not,P,Insignificant
overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner,P,Psychosocial History
to the tune of my whole <wh> my whole savings and i've had to start all over again and,P,Psychosocial History
sometimes people sat to me like,P,Insignificant
are you sure you're okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or,P,Insignificant
are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was,P,Insignificant
you know 'cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even,P,Insignificant
more difficult in a way um and uh,P,Insignificant
he stole essentially my whole life's savings essentially in a way and he was <w> got sent to prison and the f_b_i was involved interpol was involved,P,Psychosocial History
uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um,P,Insignificant
<tisk> uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't <ha> hadn't gotten involved with him in business,P,Insignificant
i wouldn't have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why,P,Insignificant
i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason uh i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see,P,Insignificant
the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten,P,Insignificant
to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish german <g>,P,Insignificant
german,P,Insignificant
uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off,P,Psychosocial History
but and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed,P,Insignificant
during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
a different world that,P,Insignificant
that would you know that i would've never,P,Insignificant
um had the chance,P,Insignificant
you know to,P,Insignificant
live through if i had not involved my,P,Insignificant
you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been the type of person who,P,Insignificant
you know money isn't everything and,P,Insignificant
i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so,P,Insignificant
there you go,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
<laughter> and for example one of my favorite,P,Insignificant
times in my life probably when i lived in kenya,P,Insignificant
and you would think that,P,Insignificant
you know a lot of people have this,P,Insignificant
really bad vision of it maybe looking living,P,Insignificant
in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it it's not like that at all but i and you'd think that with the least amount of,P,Insignificant
uh technological <tech> technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didn't have,P,Insignificant
you know that much many <m> many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best,P,Insignificant
years of my life when i was living in kenya,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
to,P,Insignificant
live your life with passion,P,Psychosocial History
and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about,P,Insignificant
making decisions,P,Insignificant
you have to make those decisions gut wise,P,Insignificant
what will,P,Insignificant
give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy,P,Insignificant
and you have to it's it's regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that 'cause that's the only thing that will yield,P,Insignificant
you know the happiness in your life,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
<tisk> the fact that i've adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and,P,Psychosocial History
follow my,P,Insignificant
passions and,P,Insignificant
you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually,P,Insignificant
decisions that are easy <ea> when you where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy that's just murphy's law that's just the way it is,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
sure,P,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
bye,P,Insignificant
