"Hi again, it’s Ellie. I’m glad to see you back today.",T,Insignificant
"Hey, thanks for having me.",P,Insignificant
"Last time we spoke about your goals and some of the challenges you’ve faced, particularly with anger management. How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve been okay, I guess. Trying to keep my cool, but it’s still tough sometimes.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like you're aware of the challenges. Have there been any specific situations where you felt your anger rising?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, actually. I had a disagreement with a coworker last week. It was over something small, but I felt my temper flare up.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What happened in that moment? How did you respond?,T,Insignificant
I just walked away. I didn’t want to say something I’d regret.,P,Current Functional Status
That’s a good strategy. Walking away can be really effective. How did you feel after you stepped away?,T,Insignificant
"A bit relieved, honestly. I didn’t want to escalate things.",P,Current Functional Status
That’s a positive reflection. It shows you’re making progress in managing your reactions. Are there any techniques you’ve been using to help with that?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been trying to breathe deeply when I feel like I’m getting angry. It helps a little.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Deep breathing is a great technique. It can really help ground you in those moments. Have you noticed any other changes in your mood or behavior since we last spoke?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve had some mood swings, still. I feel like they come out of nowhere sometimes.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Can you think of any triggers for those mood swings?,T,Insignificant
"Sometimes it’s just little things, like someone cutting me off in traffic or a comment that rubs me the wrong way.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like those small irritations can build up for you. Would it be helpful to explore some coping strategies for those moments?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think that would be good.",P,Insignificant
"Great! One technique we can try is cognitive reframing. It involves changing the way you think about a situation. For example, if someone cuts you off, instead of feeling angry, you could think, “Maybe they’re having a rough day.” What do you think about that approach?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I guess that makes sense. It’s worth a shot.,P,Insignificant
"Absolutely! It takes practice, but it can help reduce the intensity of your emotions. Are there any other areas in your life where you feel stuck or challenged?",T,Insignificant
"Well, I still feel like I’m not moving forward as quickly as I’d like in my career. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Progress can sometimes feel slow. What specific goals do you have in mind for your career?,T,Insignificant
"I want to move up at LAX, maybe into a management position.",P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
That’s a great goal! Have you thought about what steps you might need to take to reach that position?,T,Insignificant
I guess I could look into some training or courses that would help.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a solid plan. Continuous learning can really enhance your skills. Would you like to set a specific goal for the next session regarding this?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I could research some courses by next week.",P,Next Steps
Perfect! Let’s check in on that next time. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?,T,Insignificant
"No, I think that covers it for now.",P,Insignificant
