That’s great! What have you been exploring in those chapters?,T,Insignificant
I've been diving deeper into the main character’s backstory. It's interesting to see how his past shapes his decisions.,P,Insignificant
It sounds like you're really connecting with your character. How does that feel for you?,T,Insignificant
"It feels good, but sometimes it gets heavy. I find myself reflecting on my own past while writing.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. Writing can be a powerful way to process emotions. Have you noticed any particular memories or feelings coming up?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, definitely. I’ve been thinking a lot about my family and how things have changed since I moved. It’s bittersweet.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Psychosocial History
That’s understandable. It sounds like there’s a lot of unresolved feelings there. How do you cope with those feelings when they arise?,T,Insignificant

"I have, but it’s hard. I feel like I’d just be opening old wounds.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Psychosocial History
"That’s completely valid. Sometimes, taking small steps can help. Maybe starting with a text or an email could feel less daunting.",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, that could work. I just worry about how they’ll react.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s normal to feel apprehensive. What do you think might be the worst-case scenario?,T,Insignificant

That’s true. I just need to remind myself of that.,P,Insignificant
"Absolutely! You’re taking control of your narrative, and that’s empowering. What do you think would be a good first step for you?",T,Insignificant
Maybe drafting a message and sitting on it for a few days before sending it.,P,Next Steps
