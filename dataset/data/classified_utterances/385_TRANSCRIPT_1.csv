"Hi, welcome back! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"Um, I don't know. Same as usual, I guess.",P,Insignificant
"That's understandable. Sometimes things can feel a bit stagnant. Last time, you mentioned that you enjoy sleeping to relax. Have you had any new experiences or thoughts about that since we last spoke?",T,Insignificant
Not really. Just sleep.,P,Insignificant
"Sleep is important, but it sounds like you might be feeling a bit stuck. Are there any activities or hobbies you've thought about trying to mix things up a bit?",T,Insignificant
Not really. I don't have the energy for that.,P,Physiological Observations
I get that. Sometimes low energy can affect our motivation. Would you say you’ve been feeling low energy recently?,T,Physiological Observations
"Yeah, I guess. It’s just the same every day.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That can be tough. Have you noticed any specific thoughts or feelings that come up when you feel this way?,T,Insignificant
Not really. Just... nothing.,P,Insignificant
It seems like there might be a lot of “nothing” in your thoughts. Would you be open to exploring that a bit more? ,T,Insignificant
I suppose.,P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s try to unpack that. Can you think of a time recently when you felt particularly indifferent or unmotivated?,T,Insignificant
"Hmm, maybe when I was supposed to go out with friends last week. I just didn’t want to.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What do you think led to that feeling of not wanting to go out?,T,Insignificant
I don’t know. Just didn’t feel like it.,P,Insignificant
"Sometimes, that can be a sign of feeling overwhelmed or disconnected. How do you feel about social situations in general?",T,Insignificant
"They’re okay, but sometimes I just want to be alone.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s completely valid. It’s important to honor your need for alone time. Do you feel like you have a good balance between socializing and having time to yourself?,T,Insignificant
Not really. I think I spend too much time alone.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s insightful. It sounds like you might be craving some connection but also feel overwhelmed by it. Would you like to explore ways to find that balance?,T,Insignificant
"Sure, I guess.",P,Insignificant
"One approach could be to set small, manageable goals for socializing. For instance, committing to just one outing a month. How does that sound?",T,Next Steps
That could work. ,P,Next Steps
Great! We can also look at how to make those outings more enjoyable for you. What activities do you think would be fun or comfortable?,T,Insignificant
Maybe basketball with friends?,P,Next Steps
"That sounds like a great idea! Basketball is something you enjoy, and it can be a good way to connect with friends. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to them?",T,Next Steps
I think so. ,P,Next Steps
Excellent! Let’s set a goal for you to reach out to them this week. How does that feel?,T,Next Steps
I can do that.,P,Next Steps
"Wonderful! Now, let's shift gears a bit. You mentioned before that you sometimes feel guilty about things. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last talked?",T,Insignificant
Not really. I don’t feel guilty about anything.,P,Insignificant
"That’s interesting. It can be helpful to explore any feelings of guilt or shame, even if they seem small. Sometimes they can affect our mood without us realizing it. ",T,Insignificant
Okay.,P,Insignificant
Let’s try a quick exercise. Think of a recent situation where you felt something—maybe frustration or sadness. Can you share that with me?,T,Insignificant
I don’t know. I guess I felt frustrated when I saw someone driving recklessly.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. It’s understandable to feel frustrated in that situation. What do you think that frustration says about your values?,T,Insignificant
I guess I care about safety?,P,Insignificant
Exactly! Your feelings reveal what’s important to you. Recognizing those values can help guide your actions. How can you express that care for safety in your daily life?,T,Insignificant
Maybe by being more careful when I drive?,P,Next Steps
That’s a great start! Taking care of yourself and others can be empowering. How do you feel about that?,T,Insignificant
It makes sense.,P,Insignificant
"Perfect! As we wrap up today, let’s recap what you’ll focus on until our next session. You’ll reach out to your friends about basketball and practice mindful driving. How does that sound?",T,Next Steps
Sounds good.,P,Insignificant
"I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about small steps. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!",T,Insignificant
You too. Goodbye.,P,Insignificant
