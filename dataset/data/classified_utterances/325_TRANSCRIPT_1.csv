Hi again! It’s great to see you back. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Hi! I’ve been okay, I guess. Still trying to figure things out after graduating. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. Transitioning from school to the next phase can be challenging. Have you made any progress in finding a job in marine biology?,T,Insignificant
"A little. I applied to a couple of internships, but I haven’t heard back yet. It’s just frustrating because I feel like I’m not doing enough.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s understandable to feel that way, especially after such a big change. How do you cope with those feelings of frustration?",T,Insignificant
"I try to keep myself busy. I go hiking or spend time with friends, but sometimes it just feels overwhelming.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a good strategy, staying active. Have you noticed any patterns in your mood when you’re busy versus when you’re not?",T,Insignificant
"I think when I’m busy, I’m definitely happier. But when I have too much free time, my mind starts racing, and I get anxious.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Mental Health Observations
It sounds like routine and structure are important for you. Would it help to create a daily schedule to keep yourself engaged?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think that could help. I just don’t know where to start.",P,Insignificant
We can work on that together. Let’s think about what a balanced schedule might look like for you. What activities would you want to include?,T,Insignificant
"Definitely job searching, maybe some volunteer work, and then I’d like to set aside time for reading and hiking.",P,Current Functional Status
That sounds like a great mix! How about we set a goal for you to apply to at least one job or internship each week? ,T,Next Steps
"That sounds doable, yeah. I think I could manage that.",P,Next Steps
Great! And what about your self-care activities? How can we make sure you’re prioritizing those too?,T,Insignificant
I could schedule in some time for meditation and maybe a few hikes each week.,P,Next Steps
Perfect. It’s important to balance productivity with self-care. How have you been sleeping lately?,T,Mental Health Observations

Have you been consistent with your trazodone?,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
"I have, but I think my mind is just too busy at night.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a common struggle. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed, like mindfulness or deep breathing exercises?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried some deep breathing, but I often forget to do it when I’m feeling anxious.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
How about we set a reminder for that? Maybe you could also create a calming bedtime routine to help signal to your body that it’s time to wind down.,T,Next Steps
That could work. I’ll try to set a reminder on my phone.,P,Next Steps
"Excellent! Let’s check in on that next session. In the meantime, are there any specific thoughts or feelings that have come up since we last spoke that you want to discuss?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve been feeling a bit down about my future. I thought graduating would feel like a big achievement, but now I just feel lost.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s completely normal to feel that way after such a significant transition. Sometimes, the pressure of expectations can lead to feelings of uncertainty. ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I guess I didn’t expect it to hit me like this.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s okay to take time to adjust. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to not have everything figured out right away. ",T,Insignificant
That’s true. I just wish I had a clearer path.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
We can explore that together. What are some of your dreams or aspirations in marine biology? ,T,Insignificant
"I’d love to work in conservation or research, but I’m not sure how to get there.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Let’s brainstorm some steps you could take to move toward those goals. What skills or experiences do you think would enhance your chances in those fields?,T,Insignificant
I think gaining more hands-on experience would help. Maybe volunteering at an aquarium or with a conservation group.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a great plan! Would you like to research some local organizations that align with your interests?,T,Next Steps
"Yes, I’d like that. ",P,Insignificant
Wonderful! Let’s make that another goal for this week. Research at least two organizations and see how you can get involved.,T,Next Steps
