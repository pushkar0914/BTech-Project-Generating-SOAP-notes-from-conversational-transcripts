go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean,P,Psychosocial History
nice,T,Insignificant
what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from,P,Psychosocial History
so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home,P,Psychosocial History
so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom,P,Psychosocial History
and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way,P,Psychosocial History
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
experiences on vacation or,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
um most memorable experience,P,Insignificant
probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so,P,Psychosocial History
having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause,P,Psychosocial History
no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter>,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
awesome,T,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
my dream job,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook,P,Insignificant
and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family,P,Insignificant
if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now,P,Insignificant
but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
i'm outgoing,P,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
<laughter> that's cool <laughter>,P,Insignificant
uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at,P,Mental Health Observations
and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e,P,Mental Health Observations
so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation,P,Mental Health Observations
figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first,P,Mental Health Observations
mhm,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with,P,Mental Health Observations
um i don't really let anything agitate me,P,Mental Health Observations
and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just,P,Mental Health Observations
do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it,P,Mental Health Observations
be who you are and just stay there,P,Mental Health Observations
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mm,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
hmm <sigh> let's see,P,Insignificant
i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
as opposed to waiting him to call me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i think,P,Insignificant
it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but,P,Insignificant
i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and then also not expected him to just kinda you know,P,Insignificant
i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
do you find it easy to be a parent,T,Insignificant
woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so,P,Insignificant
my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that's good,T,Insignificant
what's the hardest thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just,P,Insignificant
kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but,P,Insignificant
whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's the best thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just,P,Insignificant
being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents,T,Insignificant
wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here,P,Psychosocial History
so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing,P,Psychosocial History
it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure,P,Psychosocial History
uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling,P,Psychosocial History
but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter,P,Psychosocial History
so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent,P,Psychosocial History
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and,P,Insignificant
since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
physical and and all the material stuff i could care less,P,Insignificant
but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it,P,Insignificant
bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day,P,Physiological Observations
my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night,P,Physiological Observations
i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody,P,Physiological Observations
did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma,P,Insignificant
i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today,P,Insignificant
and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to,P,Insignificant
go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little,P,Insignificant
mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no i haven't thank god,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
really happy let's see,P,Insignificant
uh it's at home and i think it was when,P,Insignificant
wow,P,Insignificant
<mumbling> different things running through my head um,P,Insignificant
i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
aw,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very,P,Insignificant
you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be,P,Insignificant
um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do,P,Insignificant
and i just you know i don't,P,Insignificant
i don't deal with b s <laughter>,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
hmm what could i change about myself,P,Insignificant
uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself,P,Insignificant
um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um,P,Insignificant
i think i would just be,P,Insignificant
a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware,P,Mental Health Observations
make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody,P,Mental Health Observations
uh huh,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me,P,Mental Health Observations
so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret,P,Mental Health Observations
because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that,P,Mental Health Observations
everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it,P,Mental Health Observations
what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys,P,Mental Health Observations
i understand,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am,P,Mental Health Observations
to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure,P,Mental Health Observations
be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me,P,Mental Health Observations
don't try to revamp <re>,P,Mental Health Observations
don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not,P,Mental Health Observations
uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders,P,Insignificant
but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it,P,Insignificant
but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments,P,Mental Health Observations
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle,P,Insignificant
that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
and i'm always just,P,Insignificant
true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
cool,P,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
bye,P,Insignificant
