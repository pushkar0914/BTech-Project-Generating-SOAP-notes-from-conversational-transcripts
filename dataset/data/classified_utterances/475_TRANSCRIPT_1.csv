Hi again! It’s great to see you. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been okay, just trying to manage everything with my wife being pregnant.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a significant change. How are you feeling about that?  ,T,Insignificant
"Excited, but also a bit overwhelmed.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. It’s a big transition. Have you noticed any specific feelings or thoughts that have been challenging for you?  ,T,Insignificant
I guess I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about being a good dad.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Anxiety about new roles can be common. What specifically worries you about being a dad?  ,T,Insignificant
Just the pressure to provide and be there for my family.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like you care deeply about your family. How do you think you can prepare yourself for this new role?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve been reading parenting books and talking to friends who are already parents.  ,P,Current Functional Status
That’s a proactive approach! Have you found any advice that resonated with you?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, a lot of it is about being present and supportive, which makes sense to me.  ",P,Insignificant
Being present is crucial. How do you plan to balance work and family time?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’m not sure yet. I want to be there for my wife and the baby, but I also have work commitments.  ",P,Current Functional Status
It might help to set boundaries around work hours. Have you thought about how to communicate those boundaries to your employer?  ,T,Insignificant
I haven’t really talked to them about it yet.  ,P,Insignificant
That might be a good conversation to have. What do you think would be a reasonable request?  ,T,Insignificant
Maybe to have flexible hours for a while after the baby arrives.  ,P,Current Functional Status
That sounds reasonable. How do you feel about approaching that conversation?  ,T,Insignificant
"A bit nervous, but I think it’s necessary.  ",P,Risk Assessment
It’s normal to feel nervous. Would it help to practice what you want to say?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, that could help.  ",P,Insignificant
Let’s role-play that conversation. I’ll be your employer. Ready?  ,T,Insignificant
Sure.  ,P,Insignificant
Hi! Thanks for coming in. What’s on your mind?  ,T,Insignificant
"Um, well, I wanted to discuss my schedule once the baby arrives.  ",P,Current Functional Status
"Okay, tell me more.  ",T,Insignificant
I’d like to request some flexibility in my hours to help support my wife and the baby.  ,P,Current Functional Status
That’s understandable. What kind of flexibility are you thinking?  ,T,Insignificant
"Maybe starting earlier or later some days, depending on our needs.  ",P,Current Functional Status
Sounds reasonable. How do you think that will impact your work?  ,T,Insignificant
I believe I can still meet my deadlines and stay productive.  ,P,Current Functional Status
Great! How did that feel for you?  ,T,Insignificant
A bit easier than I thought.  ,P,Insignificant
That’s wonderful! Remember that practice can build confidence. Have you thought about any coping strategies for your anxiety?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been running more, but sometimes it’s hard to find the time.  ",P,Current Functional Status
Exercise is a great outlet. What about incorporating mindfulness or relaxation techniques?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve heard of mindfulness, but I’m not really sure how to start.  ",P,Insignificant
Would you like to try a simple breathing exercise together?  ,T,Insignificant
"Sure, I’d like that.  ",P,Insignificant
Let’s take a deep breath in through our noses... and out through our mouths.  ,T,Insignificant
<deep breath>  ,P,Insignificant
Good. Let’s do that a few more times. In... and out...  ,T,Insignificant
<deep breath>  ,P,Insignificant
How does that feel?  ,T,Insignificant
"It feels calming, actually.  ",P,Physiological Observations
That’s great to hear! You can use this technique whenever you feel overwhelmed. How do you think you can incorporate this into your daily routine?  ,T,Insignificant
Maybe in the mornings before work or even at the gym.  ,P,Current Functional Status
That sounds like a good plan. Let’s set a goal for you to practice this technique daily. How does that sound?  ,T,Next Steps
I can do that.  ,P,Next Steps
Excellent! Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?  ,T,Insignificant
Just trying to manage my feelings about the pregnancy and work-life balance.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s a lot to juggle. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help. You don’t have to do it all alone.  ",T,Insignificant
