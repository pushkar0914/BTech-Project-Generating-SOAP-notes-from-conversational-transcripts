Hi! Welcome back. How has your week been? ,T,Insignificant
"Hi! It’s been a bit of a mixed bag, honestly.",P,Insignificant
"I see. Last time, we set some goals for you. How did the mindfulness practice and bedtime routine go?",T,Next Steps
"I tried the mindfulness in the morning a couple of times, and it was nice. The bedtime routine... well, I read once before bed, but I didn’t stick with it.",P,Progress Evaluation:Next Steps
That’s okay! It’s a process. What do you think made it hard to stick to the bedtime routine?,T,Insignificant
I think I just got too tired and ended up falling asleep on the couch instead.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. It can be hard to change habits. Would you like to brainstorm some ways to make it easier to follow through with the bedtime routine?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, that would help.",P,Insignificant
One idea could be to set a reminder on your phone to start winding down at a certain time. Would that be something you’d consider?,T,Next Steps
That could work. I usually lose track of time when I’m watching TV.,P,Insignificant
"Great! Let’s set that as a goal for this week. Now, how did you feel after practicing mindfulness?",T,Insignificant
"I did feel calmer, but some days it was hard to focus.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s completely normal. Mindfulness is a skill that takes time to develop. Have you noticed any changes in your mood since starting those practices?,T,Insignificant
"I think I’ve been a bit less irritable, but I still have my moments.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

Absolutely! Socializing can be a great way to combat feelings of sadness and isolation. Is there someone else you’d like to reach out to this week?,T,Insignificant
I might call another friend I haven’t talked to in a while.,P,Next Steps
"That sounds like a great plan! Now, let’s talk about your feelings towards your ex-husband. Have you had any new thoughts or feelings about the situation?",T,Insignificant
"I still feel angry, but I’m trying to remind myself that I can’t control his actions.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a healthy perspective. Recognizing what you can and cannot control is an important part of healing. ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, it’s just hard sometimes.",P,Insignificant
"It is hard, especially when emotions are involved. Have you been able to express your anger in a healthy way?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried talking to my friends about it, but I still bottle up a lot of it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
