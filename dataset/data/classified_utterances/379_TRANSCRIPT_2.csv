Hi! Welcome back. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been okay. I tried that pros and cons list we talked about, and it helped a bit.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s great to hear! What did you discover from the list?  ,T,Insignificant
"I realized that I have more options than I thought, which was kind of relieving.  ",P,Mental Health Observations
That’s a valuable insight. Did anything surprise you about the options you considered?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I didn’t think I’d be interested in applying for jobs outside of journalism, but some other fields caught my attention.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s interesting! What other fields are you considering?  ,T,Insignificant
"Well, I thought about public relations and even some marketing roles. They seem like they could use my skills too.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a smart way to broaden your horizons. How do you feel about these new possibilities?  ,T,Insignificant
I feel excited but also a bit scared. It’s like stepping into the unknown.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s completely normal. Change can be intimidating. How do you usually cope with that fear?  ,T,Insignificant
I try to remind myself that it’s okay to be scared. I also talk to friends for support.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a healthy approach. Have you noticed how your friends react when you share these fears?  ,T,Insignificant
They’re usually really supportive. They remind me that it’s a part of growing up.  ,P,Psychosocial History
It sounds like you have a good support system. Have you thought about how you can lean on them during this transition?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I’ll definitely reach out more. It helps to talk things through.  ,P,Next Steps
"Communication is key. Speaking of communication, how have things been with your family since our last session?  ",T,Insignificant
"It’s been a bit better. I tried to be more open about my plans, and my mom seemed to appreciate it.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s wonderful progress. How did you approach that conversation?  ,T,Insignificant
I just explained my goals and reassured her that I’d keep her in the loop about my decisions.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds effective. How did it feel to express your thoughts more assertively?  ,T,Insignificant
"It felt good, actually. I think it made her feel more included in my life choices.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s a great step towards strengthening your relationship. Are there other areas where you’d like to practice assertiveness?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I need to work on it with my friends too. Sometimes I hesitate to speak up.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What holds you back from speaking up with your friends?  ,T,Insignificant
I guess I worry about hurting their feelings or causing conflict.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common concern. What if you approached it as sharing your perspective rather than confronting them?  ,T,Insignificant
That could work. I can frame it as just sharing how I feel instead of making it a big deal.  ,P,Mental Health Observations
Exactly! It’s about expressing yourself honestly while being considerate of their feelings.  ,T,Insignificant
I like that approach. I’ll try to keep it in mind next time.  ,P,Next Steps
Good! Let’s also explore some coping mechanisms for when you feel overwhelmed in those situations. What do you usually do?  ,T,Insignificant
"I usually just take a moment to breathe, but I think I can do more.  ",P,Current Functional Status
"Breathing exercises are a great start. Have you tried any other techniques, like journaling or mindfulness?  ",T,Insignificant
"I’ve thought about journaling, but I haven’t really committed to it.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Journaling can be a powerful tool for processing emotions. Would you be open to starting a simple journaling practice?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I think I could try that. Just writing down my thoughts and feelings might help.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Absolutely! It doesn’t have to be anything formal; just write what comes to mind.  ,T,Insignificant
I’ll give it a shot. I think it could help me clarify my feelings.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Great! I’d love to hear about your experiences with it in our next session.  ,T,Next Steps
Sounds good!  ,P,Insignificant
Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?  ,T,Insignificant
I think we’ve covered a lot. I just want to keep working on being more assertive.  ,P,Next Steps
"That’s a solid goal. Remember, practice makes perfect. You’re doing really well!  ",T,Insignificant
