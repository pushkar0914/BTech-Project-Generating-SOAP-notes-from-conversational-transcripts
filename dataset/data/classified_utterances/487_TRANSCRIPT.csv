when did you move to l_a,T,Insignificant
i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here,P,Psychosocial History
many more years ago more like forty years ago,P,Psychosocial History
mm,T,Insignificant
how often do you go back to your hometown,T,Insignificant
uh i don't go back to detroit anymore,P,Psychosocial History
why,T,Insignificant
i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here,P,Psychosocial History
in california and,P,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
how does it compare to l_a,T,Insignificant
uh completely different um,P,Insignificant
for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't,P,Insignificant
the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space,P,Psychosocial History
a warmer climate warmer people,P,Psychosocial History
just a different,P,Insignificant
different uh vibe,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
that i that i like better,P,Psychosocial History
why did you move to l_a,T,Insignificant
after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
to start over here than some of the other places i had lived,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
or to stay where we were at,P,Insignificant
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a,T,Insignificant
extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it,P,Current Functional Status
plus i had also,P,Insignificant
taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here,P,Current Functional Status
and went to school out here so i was completely used to it,P,Current Functional Status
that's good,T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what are some things you really like about l_a,T,Insignificant
well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh,P,Psychosocial History
less crowded it's more open space it's a,P,Psychosocial History
a calmer friendlier vibe,P,Psychosocial History
less rushed,P,Psychosocial History
the smog would be one,P,Psychosocial History
and when i drive the traffic,P,Psychosocial History
in certain areas it can be but,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
in general,P,Insignificant
there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's,P,Psychosocial History
isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens,P,Psychosocial History
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot,T,Insignificant
i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
i don't travel as much as i used to,P,Psychosocial History
but i have traveled worldwide,P,Psychosocial History
what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
new experiences,P,Psychosocial History
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled,P,Psychosocial History
through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so,P,Psychosocial History
i've traveled a lot of different places and,P,Psychosocial History
um i'll have to say they were,P,Insignificant
all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn,P,Psychosocial History
enjoy experience,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
uh my experiences i would say in um,P,Insignificant
europe visiting moreso i've also visited,P,Psychosocial History
uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
i would probably say more shy um in general,P,Mental Health Observations
um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing,P,Mental Health Observations
although,P,Insignificant
i've had them describe me as outgoing,P,Mental Health Observations
okay,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike,P,Therapeutic Interventions
mhm,T,Insignificant
listen to music you know,P,Therapeutic Interventions
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i'm very good at controlling my temper,P,Mental Health Observations
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
oh,P,Insignificant
probably when i was,P,Insignificant
married with my husband many years ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
it could be it could be a choice of,P,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
some of the instances when i might've been with him and i,P,Insignificant
you know got emotional or,P,Insignificant
let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
just you know seen it as,P,Insignificant
not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so,P,Insignificant
you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate,P,Insignificant
but some people,P,Insignificant
you know don't respond to the so-called norm,P,Insignificant
if you ignore it,P,Insignificant
mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case,P,Insignificant
i taught middle school kids and you can try calm,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain,P,Insignificant
you know your professional demeanor so you can't really,P,Insignificant
um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
well that could be,P,Insignificant
several,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
um i guess a decision in um,P,Insignificant
along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh,P,Insignificant
that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and in that case she died so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know,P,Insignificant
uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
outcome for them as well,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry to hear that,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
<sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing,P,Insignificant
things that you might could do but,P,Insignificant
they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to,P,Insignificant
erase them you know if,P,Insignificant
you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a,P,Insignificant
strong reaction and they don't really look past the,P,Insignificant
uh impact of the event,P,Insignificant
'cause there might be something that,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
you can gain from that,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
but there are i i grew up in a home of,P,Insignificant
dysfunction so there was,P,Trauma History
just domestic abuse you know and um,P,Trauma History
there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things,P,Trauma History
but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things,P,Insignificant
that occur in life as an adult that,P,Insignificant
sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that,P,Insignificant
have not had really strong experiences,P,Insignificant
fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can,P,Insignificant
walk them through,P,Insignificant
levels of,P,Insignificant
understanding and you know,P,Insignificant
as you know someone,P,Insignificant
you have a balance of background information on,P,Insignificant
which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will,P,Insignificant
progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like,P,Insignificant
the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be,P,Insignificant
and you can also relate other experiences to them,P,Insignificant
of things that were worse or,P,Insignificant
you know seem to be,P,Insignificant
and of course there's always in general i mean,P,Insignificant
when you look at all the calamities in the world,P,Insignificant
you know most of those things aren't affecting,P,Insignificant
us or the people that we know here,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
so that provides,P,Insignificant
us perspective that,P,Insignificant
you know can pull someone out of their,P,Insignificant
i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly,P,Insignificant
intensity of their experience right at the moment,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
well we have a a good relationship they,P,Psychosocial History
eh for the most part there are different levels of,P,Psychosocial History
um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has,P,Psychosocial History
made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others,P,Psychosocial History
some have not had um,P,Insignificant
as much,P,Insignificant
experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way,P,Psychosocial History
so it's always evolving,P,Insignificant
and i,P,Insignificant
walk in positivity as a a lead of,P,Insignificant
you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender,P,Insignificant
a more positive,P,Insignificant
response from them,P,Insignificant
rather than feed,P,Insignificant
sometimes the,P,Insignificant
um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
pardon,P,Insignificant
i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends,P,Psychosocial History
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
well my mother has always been a very calm,P,Mental Health Observations
um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of,P,Psychosocial History
negativity i've had teachers that have um been,P,Psychosocial History
very um,P,Insignificant
positive <po> positive and proactive,P,Mental Health Observations
and have you know taught independent thinking and,P,Psychosocial History
techniques to rise above some of the things that,P,Insignificant
were occurring,P,Insignificant
and just various friends that you know i would see handling,P,Insignificant
situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good,P,Physiological Observations
um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or,P,Physiological Observations
you know um,P,Physiological Observations
trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but,P,Insignificant
um,P,Physiological Observations
in general i don't have a problem sleeping,P,Physiological Observations
it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so,P,Insignificant
um but in general good,P,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
i mean,P,Insignificant
not in particular,P,Insignificant
i mean i just seems,P,Insignificant
um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do,P,Insignificant
in a shorter period of time but,P,Insignificant
you know reorganizing,P,Insignificant
some of the,P,Insignificant
things that need to be done,P,Insignificant
you know can smoothe that out,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
no i haven't but i know it's something that,P,Insignificant
a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
i have not no,P,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
well there's several i guess um,P,Insignificant
and happiness comes in,P,Mental Health Observations
small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning,P,Mental Health Observations
is great,P,Mental Health Observations
wonderful,P,Insignificant
you know day of happiness um,P,Insignificant
as far as big,P,Mental Health Observations
celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Mental Health Observations
you know a moment shared with someone you know so,P,Mental Health Observations
it should be an even on an even keel,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
as uh uh,P,Mental Health Observations
perseverant,P,Insignificant
um you know i will,P,Insignificant
continue forth and,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Mental Health Observations
positive,P,Mental Health Observations
upbeat,P,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
maybe not doing,P,Insignificant
things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or,P,Insignificant
or spending my,P,Insignificant
time you know a little more differently but,P,Insignificant
that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see,P,Insignificant
you know you could've done some things differently,P,Insignificant
instead of buying,P,Insignificant
the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that,P,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
i would have um,P,Insignificant
made myself move to california sooner and i'm,P,Insignificant
i would have um,P,Insignificant
instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss>,P,Insignificant
would have you know the situation i have now,P,Insignificant
waited to get something different but you know how can you,P,Insignificant
you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time,P,Insignificant
with the best information <in> information available,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
you know after you have looked at several options,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
of um,P,Insignificant
being,P,Mental Health Observations
independent and educated able to,P,Mental Health Observations
uh take care of myself,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
