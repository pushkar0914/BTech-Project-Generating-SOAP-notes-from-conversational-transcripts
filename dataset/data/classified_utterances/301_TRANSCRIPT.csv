mhm,T,Insignificant

um what's a good example,P,Insignificant
just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
right,T,Insignificant
when was the last time that happened,T,Insignificant
uh god,P,Insignificant
i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i understand,T,Insignificant

awesome,T,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
who's been a positive <pos>,P,Insignificant
i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and,P,Psychosocial History
which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so,P,Psychosocial History
i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there,P,Psychosocial History
like what,T,Insignificant
you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently,P,Psychosocial History
instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time,P,Insignificant
mmm,T,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um i guess it depends on who you talk to,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,T,Insignificant
i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
can you give me an example of that,T,Insignificant
well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better,P,Progress Evaluation
that's good,T,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you ever served in the military,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
okay,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
nothing major,P,Insignificant
i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
there are always trade offs in life aren't there,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
um i think,P,Insignificant
i think my,P,Insignificant
in my life i knew that,P,Insignificant
i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of,P,Insignificant
mmm kind of answered itself so,P,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
right,T,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
memorable experiences um hmm,P,Insignificant
i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that,P,Insignificant
i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able,P,Current Functional Status
i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like,P,Insignificant
i've gotten somewhere,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant

um,P,Insignificant
i don't know i'm not really someone who's like,P,Insignificant
i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i,P,Psychosocial History
i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so,P,Psychosocial History
i guess to answer the question probably,P,Insignificant
mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends,P,Psychosocial History

determined,P,Psychosocial History
i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible,P,Psychosocial History
