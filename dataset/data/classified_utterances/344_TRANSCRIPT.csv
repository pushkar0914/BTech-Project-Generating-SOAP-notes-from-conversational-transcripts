to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done  ,P,Insignificant
