yelled in a long time,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well it wasn't arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just like to state my opinion,P,Insignificant
 and have it be understood and i like the person that i'm conversing with to say their,P,Insignificant
opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was,P,Insignificant
uh i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions and that sometimes,P,Insignificant
things are not ready to be written,P,Insignificant
yeah so yesterday,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
hm,P,Insignificant
guilty,P,Insignificant
that's tough i haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt,P,Insignificant
what about you what's something you feel guilty about,P,Insignificant
why don't we talk about that later,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i don't really wish i could erase anything from my memory 'cause then that would just,P,Insignificant
be like,P,Insignificant
i would feel something was lacking from my current present life if,P,Insignificant
something just got erased you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
um maybe the time,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
um she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just,P,Insignificant
kind of hanging around um but we had an apartment together with another friend,P,Insignificant
and it didn't turn out,P,Insignificant
you know not all,P,Insignificant
nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little,P,Insignificant
uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and,P,Insignificant
i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up,P,Insignificant
yeah with us separating but that's something i wish uh,P,Insignificant
maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully,P,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
the hardest decision,P,Insignificant
huh,P,Insignificant
hm maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school dropping my uh continuation of achieving being a b_f_a,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yeah that could've been the hardest,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it's just uh i don't,P,Insignificant
i mean of course money money is the motto money's a big issue tution hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support <s> not a fan of support that,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
right,T,Insignificant
but um,P,Insignificant
yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um,P,Insignificant
but another reason why i,P,Insignificant
decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was,P,Insignificant
 also because um art institute you know um that's a,P,Insignificant
that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician,P,Insignificant
being taught by a musician,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
to,P,Insignificant
make music,P,Insignificant
and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
and it's just um,P,Insignificant
yeah it's just not,P,Insignificant
quite as artistic as i thought,P,Insignificant
art would be art <shh> art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not not from out there you know so yeah,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Physiological Observations
hm,P,Insignificant
if i,P,Insignificant

it's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or if i,P,Physiological Observations
remember to breathe and go through my mantras or,P,Physiological Observations
remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into it real nice um,P,Physiological Observations
but if i just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah,P,Physiological Observations
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
um yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be uh medicated from you know a nice,P,Substance Use History
a nice indica um then it really does you know indica does put me down pretty nice,P,Substance Use History
