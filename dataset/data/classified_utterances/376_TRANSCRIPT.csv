i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep,P,Physiological Observations
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh you know thinking about bills and,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

for quite some time,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that i haven't done in a year because of what happened,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that's good,T,Insignificant

gotten over i don't know whether or not,P,Insignificant
you can so i've always taken the medicine,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i was,P,Insignificant
arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
was feeling desperate and hopeless,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago,P,Risk Assessment
which caused me to be hospitalized,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and then uh,P,Insignificant
they started treating me i started seeing a therapist,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so,P,Insignificant
is going to a therapist helping you,T,Insignificant
um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some,P,Insignificant
avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me,P,Insignificant
i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there,P,Insignificant
and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this,P,Insignificant
and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback,P,Insignificant
as to how to deal with the emotions,P,Insignificant
tools to help you deal with your emotions,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant

um,P,Insignificant
like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant

and uh,P,Insignificant
even though a lot of times i,P,Insignificant
feeled i felt overwhelmed or,P,Insignificant
lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i still was a heck of a lot happier,P,Insignificant
than i am now,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
