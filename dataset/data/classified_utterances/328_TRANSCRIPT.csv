no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

the hardest thing about being a parent ,P,Insignificant
i would say is,P,Insignificant
trying to give,P,Insignificant
that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it gets very uh ,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so   ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh huh,T,Insignificant
that sounds really hard ,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you as a parent you're happy they got it ,P,Insignificant
