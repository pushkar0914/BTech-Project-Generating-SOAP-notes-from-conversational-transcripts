You mentioned some anxiety about projects and deadlines. Have you had any experiences with that since we last talked?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)

It sounds like you handled it well. What strategies did you use to cope with the anxiety this time?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I tried to break the work into smaller tasks and set mini-deadlines for myself. It helped a lot.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That's a great approach! Breaking tasks down can make them feel less overwhelming. Do you think you could apply that strategy to other areas of your life?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I think so. I might try that with my travel plans for the year. I want to visit a few places, but it can be a lot to organize.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That sounds like a fantastic goal! Planning trips can be exciting, but it can also feel daunting. What destinations are you considering?",T,Insignificant

It seems like you have a clear vision of what you want. How do you feel about the idea of traveling again?,T,Insignificant
A little anxious but mostly excited! I just need to make sure I plan everything well.,P,Risk Assessment
It’s completely normal to feel a mix of emotions. What do you think might help lessen the anxiety as you start planning?,T,Insignificant
Maybe I can make a checklist of things I need to do and set deadlines for each task.,P,Next Steps
That’s a great idea! Having a checklist can help you feel more organized and in control. Would you like to work on that together?,T,Insignificant
"Sure, I’d appreciate that!",P,Insignificant
Let’s start by listing out the main components of your trip. What do you think is the first thing you need to consider?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I need to decide on the dates and book flights.",P,Next Steps
Excellent! Setting dates can give you a clear timeline. How do you feel about the timing of the trip?,T,Insignificant
I think late spring would be nice. The weather should be pleasant then.,P,Next Steps
Sounds perfect! What’s next on your list?,T,Insignificant
"I’ll need to look at accommodations. I want to stay somewhere that feels local, not just a hotel.",P,Next Steps
That’s a great approach. Have you considered any specific areas or types of places to stay?,T,Insignificant
I’ve heard good things about Airbnb. I think it would be nice to have a home-like atmosphere.,P,Next Steps
Airbnb can provide a unique experience. Would you like to research some options together for your next session?,T,Next Steps

"Great! Now, let’s shift gears a bit. You mentioned last time that you don’t argue much and prefer to avoid confrontation. How does that play out in your relationships?",T,Insignificant
"I think it’s mostly good. I try to keep the peace, but sometimes I feel like I’m not being heard.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valid concern. It’s important to express your needs too. Have you had any situations recently where you felt that way?,T,Insignificant

That’s understandable. How did you handle it?,T,Insignificant
"I just let it go, but I felt frustrated. I wish I could have spoken up without causing tension.",P,Risk Assessment
It’s a delicate balance. Would you like to explore ways to express your thoughts while still maintaining harmony in your relationships?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I would like that.",P,Insignificant
"One technique we could try is using ""I"" statements. For example, instead of saying, ""You always do this,"" you could say, ""I feel frustrated when this happens."" It focuses on your feelings rather than placing blame.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That makes sense. I’ll give that a try.,P,Insignificant
Wonderful! Practicing this in low-stakes situations might help you feel more comfortable using it in more significant discussions. ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I like that idea. ,P,Insignificant
"Fantastic! Before we wrap up, what would you like to focus on for our next session?",T,Insignificant
I’d like to work on the travel planning and practice those communication techniques.,P,Next Steps
