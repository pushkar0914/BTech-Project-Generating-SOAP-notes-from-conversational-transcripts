Hi! It’s great to see you again. How have the past few weeks been for you?,T,Insignificant
"They’ve been a bit of a rollercoaster, to be honest.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I’m here to listen. What’s been going on?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I tried the open-ended questions with my son, and it worked a little. He opened up about some school stress, but he still shuts down at times.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a positive step forward! It’s normal for him to have ups and downs. How did you feel when he shared his stress with you?,T,Insignificant

It’s natural to feel that way. Have you discussed ways he can manage that pressure?,T,Insignificant
"We talked about taking breaks and finding time for fun, but I think he still feels overwhelmed.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It might be helpful to explore specific activities he enjoys that could serve as a break. Have you asked him what he likes to do for fun?,T,Insignificant
Not really. I usually just suggest things I think he’d like.,P,Insignificant
Asking him directly could empower him to take ownership of his leisure time. What do you think?,T,Insignificant
That makes sense. I’ll try to ask him what he wants to do.,P,Insignificant

I think I can manage it. I just need to be proactive about it.,P,Current Functional Status
"Exactly! Being proactive is key. Shifting gears a bit, how are your self-care practices going?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve been going to the beach more often, and it’s been great. I even started journaling about my feelings.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

It’s been really cathartic. I didn’t realize how much I had bottled up.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
