yeah ,T,Insignificant
do you feel like therapy's useful ,T,Insignificant
i do,P,Insignificant
at some point i've had,P,Insignificant
some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists ,P,Insignificant
um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me,P,Insignificant
and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen  ,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist,P,Insignificant
yeah i see what you mean ,T,Insignificant
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i'm not going to therapy now but ,P,Insignificant
the therapy that i had before um ,P,Insignificant
was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication,P,Insignificant
um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better ,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
why did you stop ,T,Insignificant
um i just,P,Insignificant
i wasn't getting the right therapists recently,P,Insignificant
so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so ,P,Substance Use History
mhm,T,Insignificant
mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah ,T,Insignificant
okay ,T,Insignificant
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed ,T,Insignificant
um ,P,Insignificant
i can't really think of anything right now ,P,Insignificant
okay ,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you felt really happy ,T,Insignificant
um ,P,Insignificant
it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm sorry to hear that ,T,Insignificant
thank you <sniffle>,P,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences ,T,Insignificant
um ,P,Insignificant
okay when i was a kid,P,Insignificant
um ,P,Insignificant
i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it ,P,Trauma History
so then a little while later my father ,P,Insignificant
came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them ,P,Insignificant
so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that  ,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,T,Insignificant
<laughter> ,T,Insignificant
oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences  ,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
that's great ,T,Insignificant
yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so ,P,Insignificant
yeah ,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret ,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
just the way that i've treated people before when,P,Insignificant
i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people,P,Insignificant
when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so ,P,Substance Use History
mhm,T,Insignificant
so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable ,P,Substance Use History
that's good,T,Insignificant
yeah ,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ,T,Insignificant
get in a career that is really stable ,P,Insignificant
like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney,P,Insignificant
something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so,P,Insignificant
you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things ,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
that makes sense ,T,Insignificant
what are some things that usually put you in a good mood ,T,Insignificant
um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work ,P,Current Functional Status
uh when i'm helping other people ,P,Current Functional Status
uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood ,P,Current Functional Status
that's great ,T,Insignificant
okay i think i've asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
