Hi there! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
Hey! I’ve been doing okay. I actually tried writing down some ideas like we talked about.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful! How did that go for you?,T,Insignificant
It felt really freeing. I just wrote whatever came to mind without worrying about it being perfect.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a fantastic approach! Did any specific ideas stand out to you during that process?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I came up with a couple of funny sketches. One is about a guy who can’t stop getting stuck in awkward situations.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds hilarious! Have you thought about how you might develop that further?,T,Insignificant
I was thinking of maybe writing a script for it. Just to see how it flows.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great next step. How do you feel about sharing your ideas with others once you have them written down?,T,Insignificant
I’m a little nervous about that. What if they don’t find it funny?,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s natural to feel that way, but remember that feedback can be constructive. It can help you grow as a creator. ",T,Insignificant
True. I guess I just need to remind myself that not everyone will like everything.,P,Insignificant
"Exactly! It’s part of the creative journey. Speaking of journeys, how has your sleep routine been since we last spoke?",T,Insignificant
"It’s been a bit better! I started watching lighter shows before bed, and it seems to help.",P,Physiological Observations
That’s great news! Have you noticed any changes in your dreams or sleep quality?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’ve had fewer nightmares, which is a relief. I still have some vivid dreams, but they’re not as scary.",P,Physiological Observations
That’s a significant improvement. It sounds like you’re making progress. Are there any other strategies you’ve been using to help with your sleep?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to stick to a bedtime routine, like reading a book before bed instead of jumping straight into a show.",P,Physiological Observations
That’s a wonderful practice. Establishing a calming routine can signal your body that it’s time to wind down. ,T,Insignificant
I think it helps. I feel more relaxed when I do it.,P,Physiological Observations
Excellent! Have you been able to maintain your communication with Ryan?,T,Insignificant
"We’ve been checking in more regularly, and it’s been nice. We’re still working on rebuilding that trust.",P,Psychosocial History
That’s a positive development. It’s great to hear you’re taking steps to mend that friendship. How do you feel about the progress you’re making in your relationships overall?,T,Insignificant
"I feel hopeful. I’m learning to be more open and honest, which is nice.",P,Psychosocial History
"That’s a valuable lesson. Remember, building strong relationships takes time and effort, but it sounds like you’re on the right path. ",T,Insignificant
Thanks! I feel like I’m starting to understand that better.,P,Insignificant
"I’m glad to hear that. As we continue our sessions, is there a specific area you’d like to focus on today?",T,Insignificant
I think I’d like to talk more about managing my emotions. I still feel overwhelmed sometimes.,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
That’s an important topic. Can you identify any specific triggers that lead to those overwhelming feelings?,T,Insignificant
I think it’s mostly stress from school and my relationships. Sometimes it just feels like too much.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Balancing school and personal life can be challenging. Have you tried any coping strategies when you start to feel overwhelmed?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to take breaks and step back when I need to, but it doesn’t always work.",P,Current Functional Status
It’s good that you’re aware of the need for breaks. Would it help to create a list of activities you enjoy that you can turn to when you’re feeling stressed?,T,Insignificant
That sounds like a good idea. I could use that as a reminder.,P,Insignificant
Absolutely! It can serve as a quick reference to help you decompress. What activities would you consider adding to that list?,T,Insignificant
"I like going for walks, watching comedies, or even just doodling.",P,Insignificant
Those are all great options! Let’s work on creating that list together. It can be a helpful tool for you to have.,T,Insignificant
I’d like that. It’ll be nice to have something to refer to when I’m feeling overwhelmed.,P,Insignificant
"Perfect! We can also explore some mindfulness techniques in our next session, which may help you manage those overwhelming feelings in the moment. ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds interesting. I’d love to learn more about that.,P,Insignificant
"Great! We’ll dive into that next time. For now, let’s summarize what you’d like to focus on for the upcoming week.",T,Insignificant
"I’ll work on my sleep routine, continue writing my sketches, and create that list of activities for stress relief.",P,Next Steps
That sounds like a solid plan! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next session. ,T,Insignificant
"Me too! Thanks for all your help, Ellie.",P,Insignificant
