History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been doing pretty well! I wrote some memories about my mom like we talked about.   It was emotional but also comforting. I felt good to reflect on the positive times.   I remembered a trip we took to the coast. It was one of my favorite memories.   We just had a lot of fun together, and I felt really happy.   I haven’t, but I think I might share them with a friend.   I’m a bit nervous, but I feel prepared.  "
