History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing well. I actually wrote that letter to my son. It felt really cathartic. I poured my heart out on the page.  I talked about my memories with him and how much I miss him. I also shared my hopes for the future. I did! I found an address and sent it off. I don’t know if he’ll get it, but it felt good to send it. I feel lighter, like I’ve released some of the weight I was carrying.  I think I will. It’s a good way to keep my feelings in check and stay connected. Yes! I started volunteering at a local addiction recovery center. Yes! I wrote a couple of new poems inspired by my experiences at the recovery center. It really is. I feel like I’m tapping into a part of myself that I’ve neglected for a while."

Current Functional Status,"It’s been really fulfilling. I’m learning a lot and meeting some great people. I feel like I’m making a difference, even if it’s just a small one. It’s nice to be in a supportive environment. I try to remind myself that I’m there to help, not to carry their burdens. I also talk to the other volunteers about my feelings."
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,"It’s been helpful. I feel more in control of my emotions when I take those moments for myself. Yes, I feel more balanced. I’m not letting things affect me as much as before. I think we’ve covered a lot. I feel good about where I’m at."
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,I’ve been practicing mindfulness. I take a few minutes to breathe and center myself when I feel overwhelmed.
Next Steps,I want to continue volunteering and possibly look for part-time counseling jobs as well. I think it’ll keep me motivated. Of course! Let’s set a goal for our next session. Maybe you can share one of your new poems with me? I’d be happy to do that!
