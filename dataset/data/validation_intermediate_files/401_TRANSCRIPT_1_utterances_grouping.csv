History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I've been okay, a bit more anxious than usual, but managing. I'm glad to hear you're managing. You mentioned feeling anxious. Can you tell me more about what's been causing that? Well, I've been thinking a lot about my acting career and the opportunities I want to pursue. Sometimes it feels overwhelming. I’m trying to get auditions for some local theater productions. I feel like I need to get more experience, but the competition is tough. It makes me second-guess myself a lot. I worry that I’m not good enough or that I’ll miss out on opportunities. I try to remind myself of the positive feedback I’ve received in the past, but sometimes it just feels like I’m not making any progress. I think I need to work on my physical health. I’ve been eating out a lot lately, and I want to get back to cooking healthy meals. Great! Now, let’s talk about your family. You mentioned your grandmother's passing last time. How have you been coping with that loss? It’s been tough. I still miss her a lot. Sometimes I just want to call her and share what’s going on in my life. I’ve been looking through old photos and remembering the good times we had. It helps a little. I feel a bit lighter. Talking about my grandmother and setting goals makes me feel more focused."

Physiological Observations,"Wonderful! Last session, we talked about your sleep patterns. How has your sleep been lately? It’s been a bit better, actually. I’ve been trying to stick to a bedtime routine, so that helps. I’ve been reading before bed instead of scrolling on my phone, which I think helps me unwind. Yes, I feel less anxious at night, which is nice. I think I’m falling asleep faster too."

Therapeutic Interventions,"It’s great that you’re trying to focus on the positive. Would it be helpful to keep a list of those positive experiences to refer back to when you're feeling down? That could be helpful, yeah. I think I’ll try that."
Next Steps,"Excellent! Let’s set that as a goal for this week. You can jot down any positive feedback or accomplishments, no matter how small. How does that sound? Sounds good! I can do that. Would you like to set a goal around cooking more this week? Perhaps planning a few meals? Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I can plan for a couple of dinners. Perfect! Let’s aim for at least two healthy meals this week. How do you feel about that? I feel good about it. I think I can manage that. That sounds lovely! Baking can be a comforting activity. Would you consider baking some cookies in her honor? That’s a nice idea! I think I might do that this weekend."
