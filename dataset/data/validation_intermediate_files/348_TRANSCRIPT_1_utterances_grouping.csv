History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I've been okay, I guess. Just the same ups and downs. Not really. I still feel pretty down. I try to keep busy, but it’s hard. I went to the beach a couple of times. That was nice, but I didn’t feel as happy as I used to. I guess I just feel like I’m going through the motions. Like, I’m there, but I’m not really present. Maybe when I was with my kids during the holidays. That felt nice. But it’s like it fades away quickly. I just feel... empty, I guess. Like I’m missing something. Not really. I’ve heard about it, but I’m not sure how to do it. Just how I feel like I’m stuck in this rut. I want to feel better but don’t know how. I think it’s just a mix of everything. Work, family, just life. It feels overwhelming sometimes. I usually just shut down. I don’t want to deal with anything. Yeah, I think I need that."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I think it’s just being with them, sharing laughs and memories. It reminds me of the good times. Not really. I don’t want to burden them with my problems. I don't know. They might worry, and I don’t want to make them feel bad. I guess I could try. Maybe just a little bit."

Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that. Let’s set a goal for you to practice this mindfulness exercise a few times this week. How does that feel? That sounds doable. I’ll give it a shot. Great! We can start by identifying small steps you can take when you feel overwhelmed. For instance, reaching out to someone for support or taking a short walk. What do you think? I could try that. I think I need to be more proactive. That’s a positive mindset! Let’s focus on that for our next session. Remember, it’s okay to take small steps. "
