History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, a bit up and down, but overall not too bad. It's been a mixed bag, honestly. Some days I'm really productive, and other days I just feel stuck. I think it’s partly fear of failure. I put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed, and when I don't, it really gets to me. Well, I’ve been trying to write every day, but some days I just can’t find the motivation.  I think it’s a mix of self-doubt and distractions. Sometimes I just scroll mindlessly on my phone instead of writing. I’ve tried setting timers for writing sessions, but I struggle to stick to it when I’m not feeling inspired. When I feel inspired, I can write for hours. It’s like everything just flows out of me. I think being around other creative people helps, or sometimes just getting out of the house and experiencing new things. Not really. I’ve been a bit reclusive lately, just stuck in my routine. There’s a local writer’s group that meets weekly. I’ve been meaning to join but haven’t yet."

Therapeutic Interventions,"It might be helpful to practice reframing those thoughts. For example, instead of ""I'm not good enough,"" you could say, ""I am learning and growing as a writer."" How does that sound? That sounds like a good idea. I can try that. Awesome! Let’s work on that together. If you catch yourself thinking negatively, try to write down the thought and then reframe it. I can do that. I’ll keep a journal for it. Perfect! Journaling can also help you track your progress and reflect on your feelings. How do you feel about that? I think it’s a good idea. It’ll give me a chance to see how I’m improving over time."
Next Steps,"Maybe if I just go to observe first without sharing anything. Just to get a feel for it. That’s a smart approach. Observing can help ease the pressure. Would you like to set a goal to attend the next meeting? Yes, I think I can do that!"
