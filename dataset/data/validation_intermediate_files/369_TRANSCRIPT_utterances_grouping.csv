History of Present Illness (HPI),set yet it's just i'm still trying to find my interests i suppose um i love working with children so i would say probably a child psychologist just 'cause you know it's great you know to learn what's going on in the young minds and you know how we could help children develop a better way you know make children you know or help you know help them you know grow up in a positive way i supposed instead of like going the wrong track uh it depends it depends on the situation i'm in sometimes you know i could be like super outgoing and just like you know and sometimes like it just i could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention you know if i'm like in class or whatever i like to kick my feet up on the couch and like read a good book you know just i'm okay with it i'm not like the best you know temper controlling person there is out there you know i try my best and i guess that's all i could do until i keep doing better eventually i mean i sometimes i do have my outbursts you know um i i don't know <laughter> i've i've uh sometimes i'm very passive that i'll just like let things go 'cause i mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things when i was younger i you know uh could've been better older sister and i i wasn't and that makes me feel guilty for sure you know i could've been a better sister better role model <laughter> you know but i'm trying my best now so i'm trying to make things better i'm the person that i am because of the events that have happened in my life so uh been feeling good yeah i've been feeling really good um you know a lot of things in my life have you know it i'm having a really good year so far so i'm very happy with that you know everything's you know going good you know when the doctor told me i was pregnant really really happy about that and i was just like ah you know <laughter> that was really really good you know very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time <laughter> i've never really like uh you know but yeah i've yeah very happy like i said i'm i'm happy with the person i am right now and you know my flaws or whatever you know i might have whatever flaw people see in me and it'ts okay you know i'm okay with it just my childhood with my sisters and my family but you learn from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve go back on is death you know you could you know the heartbreak or it's whatever but you know as long as i'm alive i'm just i still gotta keep going i guess that i'm trying my best to be the best i could be and that's pretty powerful you know i i'm you know improve myself every day very hard <laughter> i'm not gonna lie um it is really hard you know 'cause i can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know
