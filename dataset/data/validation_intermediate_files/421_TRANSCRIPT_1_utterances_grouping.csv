History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. Last time, we talked a bit about your feelings of anger and sadness related to your ex-husband. Have those feelings changed at all? Not really. I still feel angry when I think about him and the situation. It's hard to let go. That makes sense. Anger can be a tough emotion to process. Have you found any coping strategies that help you manage those feelings? I try to distract myself with music or spending time with my son, but it doesn’t always work. Fantastic! Now, last time you mentioned feeling down and irritable. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for those feelings since we last spoke? I think it mostly happens when I think about my ex or when I’m really tired. "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Great! One technique that might help is mindfulness. It can help you stay present and reduce feelings of anger. Have you ever tried mindfulness exercises? Mindfulness can be as simple as focusing on your breath for a few minutes or observing your surroundings without judgment. Would you like to try a short exercise together now? Alright, let's take a moment. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable. Take a deep breath in... and out. Focus on the sensation of your breath. Notice how your body feels with each inhale and exhale. Good. If your mind wanders, gently bring your focus back to your breath. How does it feel to just focus on your breathing?"
Next Steps,"That’s wonderful to hear! Mindfulness can be a good tool for when you feel overwhelmed. How do you think you might incorporate it into your daily routine? Maybe I could do it for a few minutes in the morning before the kids wake up. That sounds like a great idea! Starting your day with mindfulness could set a positive tone. Would you be willing to try that this week? Yeah, I’ll give it a shot. Have you considered any changes to your nighttime routine that might help with your sleep? That’s understandable. Sometimes small changes can make a big difference. Would you be open to discussing a few strategies for improving your sleep? One strategy could be to establish a calming bedtime routine. This might include activities like reading, gentle stretching, or limiting screen time before bed. What do you think? That sounds doable. I could try reading before bed instead of scrolling on my phone. That’s a great idea! Reading can be a wonderful way to wind down. Let’s set that as a goal for this week.  Okay, I can do that. That’s wonderful! It sounds like spending time with friends can really uplift your mood. Would you like to plan another social outing this week? Yes, I think I need that. I’ll reach out to another friend. Before we wrap up, let’s review the goals we’ve set for this week. You’re going to try mindfulness in the morning, establish a calming bedtime routine, and plan a social outing. How does that sound? That sounds manageable. I feel like I can do that."
