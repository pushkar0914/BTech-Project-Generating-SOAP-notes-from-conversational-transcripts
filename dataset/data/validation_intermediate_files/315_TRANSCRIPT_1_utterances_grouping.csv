History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I have. I’ve been trying to communicate better with my girlfriend about how we want to raise our daughter. It was a bit rocky at first. We both have strong opinions, but we managed to talk it out without arguing this time. I tried to listen more and not interrupt, which is hard for me sometimes. I also took a few deep breaths before responding. Yeah, I felt less angry this time. I think being more patient helped. She noticed I was trying and appreciated it. It felt good to have a constructive conversation. I think we need to talk about discipline strategies more. I want to be on the same page with her. I feel good about it. I want to ensure we’re both comfortable with how we discipline her. I think it would help her understand boundaries better. Kids need that structure, I believe. I want to focus on being clear about expectations, especially with schoolwork and respect. She seems a bit overwhelmed sometimes. I think she needs more encouragement. I still struggle with that. I get frustrated when I mess up."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Maybe I can spend more quality time with her, like doing fun activities together after we address the serious stuff. She loves art, so maybe we can do some painting together.  I could praise her efforts more and remind her that it’s okay to make mistakes. We can work on reframing how you view mistakes and develop coping strategies. How does that sound?"
Next Steps,"Excellent! For our next session, let’s plan to discuss specific discipline strategies and how to encourage your daughter. Does that work for you? Yes, that works. "
