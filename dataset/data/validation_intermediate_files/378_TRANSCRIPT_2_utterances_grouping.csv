History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay, but I still feel a bit overwhelmed.   I tried meal prepping, but it didn’t go as planned.   I didn’t have enough time and ended up rushing it.   They didn’t turn out great, and I ended up just ordering takeout anyway.   I learned that I need to give myself more time and plan better.   Yes! I reached out to a couple of people.   One person agreed to meet for coffee next week, so I’m excited but nervous.  "

Psychosocial History,"I’ve been trying to reach out more, but sometimes I feel like I’m bothering people.   Yes! I had dinner with a friend last week, and it was really nice.   It did! I laughed a lot, which I needed.  "

Next Steps,Maybe two hours on Sundays?   I could try that!   I want to learn more about their work and see if they have any advice for getting started in the field.   I want to ask about their career path and how they got their first clients.   I could plan more outings with friends or maybe even join a class.   Maybe a cooking class or something creative like painting.   That’s true. I’ll look into it.   I think I’ll go to that coffee meeting and look for a class to join.
