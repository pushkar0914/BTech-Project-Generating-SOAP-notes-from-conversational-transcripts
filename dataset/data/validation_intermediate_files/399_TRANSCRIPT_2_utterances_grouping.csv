History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay. I tried practicing mindfulness like we talked about. It was a little challenging at first, but I felt more relaxed after a few times. Yeah, it helped a bit. I felt less overwhelmed when I took those moments to breathe. It felt good. I didn’t feel so alone. Yes, but I tried to handle them differently. I reminded myself it was okay to feel that way. I felt less guilty about it. I just let myself be, instead of pushing through. I’ve been thinking about my family a lot. I still feel kind of distant from them. I just wish we could connect better, but sometimes it feels like we’re speaking different languages. I feel a bit nervous, but I think it could be worth it. Just figuring out how to connect with them better. I want to feel closer."

Next Steps,"I want to keep practicing mindfulness and maybe talk to my friends more when I feel down. I think I’ll aim to practice mindfulness every day, even if it’s just for a few minutes. I could set a reminder on my phone. I’m not sure. Maybe I could try to share more about my life with them. That sounds manageable. I could tell them about my essay. Maybe we can talk more about family dynamics and how to improve those connections."
