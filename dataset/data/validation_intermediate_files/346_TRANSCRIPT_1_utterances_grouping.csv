History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's good to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep since we last spoke?   I think I was just really tired from being out and about. I spent time with friends and just tried to stay active.   Yeah, I went to a comedy show, and it was a lot of fun. Laughter really helps.   I felt lighter, like a weight was lifted. But then I crashed afterward and felt down again.   I think it’s just the reality setting back in. Like, I have fun, but then I remember my worries.   Not really. I mean, I try to distract myself, but sometimes it feels like I’m just avoiding the problem.   Yeah, actually. A few days ago, I had a really bad day. I felt anxious all day, and it just spiraled.   I was just thinking about my future and how uncertain everything feels, especially with acting.   I ended up just isolating myself. I didn’t want to talk to anyone.   I felt worse, honestly. I regretted not reaching out to my boyfriend.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Mindfulness can help ground you in the present moment and reduce anxiety. Would you like to try a simple exercise with me?   Let’s take a moment to focus on our breath. Inhale deeply through your nose... and exhale slowly through your mouth.   Great. As you breathe, notice any tension in your body and try to let it go with each exhale.  "
Next Steps,"Maybe I could try writing down my feelings or something.   Writing can be a powerful tool for processing emotions. Would you be willing to commit to journaling when you feel overwhelmed?   Yeah, I can try that.   Wonderful! You can practice this whenever you feel anxiety rising. Would you be willing to try this at home?   Yeah, I think I could do that.  "
