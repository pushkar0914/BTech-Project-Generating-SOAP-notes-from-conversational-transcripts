Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,I’d like to discuss more about managing anxiety and maybe dive deeper into my feelings about my family dynamics.
Trauma History,Nothing reported
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I realized I often jump to conclusions about my future, which increases my anxiety.  I think it’s a mix of societal pressure and my own expectations. I want to be successful, but I fear I’m not moving fast enough. I think I’m on the right path with my volunteering and art, but I still feel that nagging anxiety about not doing enough. Not really. I tend to brush them off as “not enough.”  It’s getting easier to focus, but I still struggle with racing thoughts sometimes."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Success for me is about impact and fulfillment, not just money or status. I want to feel like I’m making a difference. It felt amazing. I felt connected to the community, like my art was actually reaching people."
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,"It feels liberating, like I’m not my thoughts. I can observe them instead of being overwhelmed."

Progress Evaluation,Hey Ellie! I’ve been okay. I’ve been trying to practice some of the techniques we talked about.
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been meditating more regularly and trying to journal my thoughts. It’s been revealing. I could keep a visual reminder of the mural or maybe even journal about that experience. I’ve been practicing mindfulness and just acknowledging the thoughts without judgment.  I think I could remind myself that it’s okay to not have everything figured out right now. I can just focus on the present. I can set aside time for my art and meditation, and maybe limit my social media use to reduce external pressure."
