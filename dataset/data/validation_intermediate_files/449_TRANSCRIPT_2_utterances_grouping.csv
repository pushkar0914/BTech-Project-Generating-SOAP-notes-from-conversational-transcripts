History of Present Illness (HPI),"I actually did invite him over! He came, and we had a nice dinner together. It felt good to reconnect. It was surprisingly easy. We talked about his job and some of his interests, and I felt like I got to know him a bit better. I felt relieved and happy. It reminded me that he’s still the same person, just navigating life in his own way. We’ve had a couple of good talks. I’m trying to be more present and listen to her without jumping to conclusions. I’ve learned that she has a lot on her mind, just like I do. Sometimes, she just needs to vent without me trying to solve her problems. I guess I’m just wondering if I’m doing enough as a parent. Sometimes I doubt myself."
