History of Present Illness (HPI),"They’ve been a bit up and down, to be honest. It was tough. I tried to express my feelings, but he got defensive. Frustrated and kind of sad. I felt like he wasn’t really listening to me. I think I did, but it didn’t go as well as I hoped.  I’ve been trying to check in with myself more often. It’s hard sometimes, but I’m getting better. I’ve noticed I get anxious before big conversations, like with my dad. I think it’s the fear of conflict. I don’t want to hurt his feelings."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I try to breathe and remind myself to stay calm.  Mindfulness can help you stay present and reduce anxiety. Would you like to try a simple breathing exercise together? Okay, let’s take a deep breath in for four counts... hold it for four... and exhale for four. Let’s do that a couple of times. Great! Practicing that before difficult conversations can help you feel more centered. "
Next Steps,Maybe I could choose a different time or setting when he’s more relaxed. I’ll definitely try that. I want to keep working on my emotional awareness and try the breathing exercise before my next conversation.
