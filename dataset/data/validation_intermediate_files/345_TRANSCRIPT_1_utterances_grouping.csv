History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's good to hear. Last time we talked about your PTSD and how you've been coping with it. Have you noticed any changes or improvements since we last spoke? Yeah, actually, I have. I've been going for walks more regularly, and it really helps clear my mind. That's a great start! Mindfulness can really help with racing thoughts. Are there any particular triggers you've noticed that lead to those racing thoughts? I guess I’m just worried about finding a new therapist. I hope it goes well."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I've been trying to focus on my breathing and just being present, you know? It's not always easy, but I’m working on it. One technique we could consider is grounding exercises. These can help you stay connected to the present moment. Would you like to try one together now? Great! Let’s start by taking a deep breath in... and out. Now, as you breathe, can you name five things you can see around you? Um, I see the chair, the window, a plant, your notebook, and the picture on the wall. Excellent! Now, can you name four things you can feel? I can feel the chair against my back, my hands on my lap, the air on my face, and my feet on the floor. Good job! Now, three things you can hear? I hear your voice, the clock ticking, and some birds outside. Perfect! Two things you can smell? I can smell the coffee and some flowers. And finally, one thing you can taste? I can taste the mint from my gum. Well done! How do you feel after doing that exercise? How about we focus on active listening? This means really paying attention to what the other person is saying without interrupting. Do you think you could practice that?"
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that! You can use this technique whenever you feel overwhelmed. Do you think you can practice this during your walks? Yes, I’ll definitely try that. That’s wonderful progress. It shows that you’re working on your temper. Would it be helpful to set some goals for how you can communicate better with your family? That’s a great starting point. It’s important to feel comfortable and understood. Perhaps we can brainstorm some questions you can ask during your first session to ensure it’s a good fit for you. Alright, let’s make a list of those questions. You might ask about their experience with PTSD and depression, or their approach to therapy.  I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. Let’s check in again next week, okay?"
