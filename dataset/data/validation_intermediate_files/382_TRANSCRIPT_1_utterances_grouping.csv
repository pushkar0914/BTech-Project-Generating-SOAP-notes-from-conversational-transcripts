History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's good to hear. Last time, we talked about your move to L.A. and how it was a bittersweet decision. Have you had any new thoughts or reflections on that since we spoke? I think I've become more grateful for the opportunities here. I still miss home sometimes, but I feel like I belong here now."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,I guess I’ve been thinking about my relationships too. I want to make sure I’m nurturing my friendships while pursuing my career.
Risk Assessment,"Yeah, sometimes I struggle with self-doubt. I worry if my work is good enough or if I’ll ever make it in the industry. I try to remind myself that everyone has doubts and that it's part of the process. I talk to my friends for support too. Definitely. I tend to doubt myself more when I'm starting something new or when I'm waiting for feedback."
Mental Health Observations,It felt calming. I could feel my heart rate slow down a bit. I feel recharged and happy. It’s nice to have that support and fun outside of work.
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,"I've been working on some short films and collaborating with friends on projects. It's exciting to be creating again. It's really fulfilling. I love bringing ideas to life and working with others who are passionate about film too. I feel a sense of accomplishment. It's motivating and makes me want to keep going. I try to set aside weekends for friends, but sometimes I get caught up in projects and forget."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Great! One technique we could explore is mindfulness. It can help ground you and reduce anxiety. Would you like to try a brief mindfulness exercise together? Okay, let's take a moment. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable, and take a deep breath in through your nose... and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of your breath.  Notice any thoughts that come up, but try to let them pass like clouds in the sky. Just focus on your breath for a moment. That's wonderful! Practicing mindfulness regularly can help you manage those moments of self-doubt. Would you be willing to incorporate this into your routine? Yes, I think I could do that. Maybe in the mornings before I start working."
Next Steps,"That’s great to hear! Perhaps we can explore ways to prioritize those social connections in your schedule moving forward.  I’d like that. I think it would help with my overall well-being. Absolutely! Let’s work on finding a balance that feels right for you. For now, would you like to set a small goal to connect with friends this week? Yes! I’ll reach out to a couple of friends and plan something for this weekend."
