Psychosocial History,"A couple of people, yes. It’s nice to have a little social interaction outside of work. It’s been good. We spend more time together, and I think she appreciates the help with her garden. We had a good conversation last weekend. We talked about setting aside time for each other. It went well. We both agreed to be more open and honest about our feelings. Yes, I do. I think we’re both willing to work on it, which is a good sign. I think we need to discuss our expectations and boundaries moving forward. Yes, that would be helpful. I want to be clear about what I need from her too. I need more communication and reassurance. I want to feel valued and heard. I think I can tell her that I appreciate her support and that I need to feel more connected."

Physiological Observations,"I think I’m sleeping a bit better. I feel more tired at night, but in a good way."
Current Functional Status,"I’ve been doing well! I started walking three days a week like we discussed. It feels great to be active again. I even joined a local gym to mix things up. It’s been good! I’m still getting used to it, but I’m enjoying the classes they offer. Yes, I’ve kept up with that too. I think it helps me unwind after my workouts. I feel a bit nervous, but I think it’s necessary. I think that covers a lot. I’m feeling good about where I’m at right now."
