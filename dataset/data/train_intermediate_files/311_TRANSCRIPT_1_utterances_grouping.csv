History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I've been okay, I guess. A bit up and down. Well, I've had some good days, but there are moments when I feel really low again. Sometimes it’s just little things, like hearing a noise at night or feeling overwhelmed with everything. Yes, actually. I had an argument with my neighbor last week. They were being loud again, and I just snapped. I yelled at them."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I felt bad. I don’t like being confrontational, but they push my buttons. I usually just try to avoid them more, but it makes me feel isolated. They might get defensive. They usually do."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I haven’t really tried that. I usually just go to bed and hope for the best. That’s a common approach. Maybe we can explore some relaxation techniques together that you could incorporate into a routine? Great! One technique could be mindfulness meditation. It can help calm your mind before bed. Would you like to try that? It feels calming. I didn’t realize how much I needed to just breathe. I could set aside a few minutes before bed to do this. It might help me unwind. Maybe I could talk to them calmly instead of yelling. I just get so frustrated. That’s a great insight! Practicing assertive communication could help. Would you like to role-play how that conversation might go? I’d say something like, “Hey, can we talk? I’ve been feeling overwhelmed by the noise.” I guess I could just keep repeating how their noise affects me without blaming them."
Next Steps,Sounds good. I’ll try to practice the mindfulness and the conversation.
