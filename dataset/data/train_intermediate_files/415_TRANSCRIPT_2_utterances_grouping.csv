History of Present Illness (HPI),"They were excited, and we started discussing potential investment strategies. It felt good to make progress together. It made me feel motivated. I think we’re really serious about this now. That’s an incredible feeling! It sounds like you’re building a solid foundation for your future. Have you noticed any shifts in your mood or stress levels since you started this process? I finally did! I mentioned it to my sisters, and they were really supportive. It felt good to share. I think I want to keep it going. It feels good to be open with them. I’ve been thinking about my career path. I love my job, but I wonder if I should be doing something more. I love helping people and being part of the creative process. But sometimes I feel like I want to be more involved in decision-making. I haven’t, but maybe I should! I just worry they’ll think I’m not grateful for my current position."

I didn’t realize how much I was holding in until I talked about it."
