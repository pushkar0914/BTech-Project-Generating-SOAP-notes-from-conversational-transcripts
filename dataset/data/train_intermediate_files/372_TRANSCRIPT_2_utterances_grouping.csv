History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been trying to stick to my goals, but it’s been a bit of a struggle. Well, I started journaling more positively, but I still find myself slipping back into negative thoughts. It’s frustrating. I think it’s when I reflect on my custody situation. It just brings up so many fears and insecurities. I haven’t, but that might help. If I acknowledge them, maybe they won’t feel so overwhelming. Yes, there was a day last week when I got into a big argument with my husband. I felt so overwhelmed afterward. We were arguing about my sister again. He feels like she’s too much of a burden, and I just want him to understand my side. I felt angry and frustrated. Afterward, I just felt guilty for not being able to communicate better. I think I need to be more assertive. I often just go along with what he wants to avoid conflict. I feel overwhelmed when my sister is here because it adds extra stress to my day-to-day life. It feels empowering. I wish I could say that to him without feeling guilty."
