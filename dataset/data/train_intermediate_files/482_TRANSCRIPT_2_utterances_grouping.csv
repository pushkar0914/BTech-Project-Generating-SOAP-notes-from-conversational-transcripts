Next Steps,"Yes, I want to. I think I’ll try to visit him more often. I think we’ll talk to them about it more and maybe visit the area before we move. Maybe involve them in the packing process and let them choose some things to bring. I think that would make them feel included. Your intentions are clear, and that’s a great foundation. As we wrap up today, let’s set a goal for you to have an open conversation with your kids about the move and involve them in the packing process. How does that sound? That sounds perfect!
