History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I've been okay, a little up and down, but managing. Well, I’ve been trying to go out more, but some days it feels tougher than others.  I think it depends on how I’m feeling emotionally. If I’m more anxious, I really struggle to leave the house. Yeah, sometimes it hits me when I’m in crowded places or if I feel trapped.  It tends to happen when I’m in unfamiliar places, or if I’m feeling vulnerable."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I have! I try to remind myself that my thoughts aren’t reality, but it’s hard when I’m in the moment. Yeah, I think so. I just need to remember that those thoughts aren’t true."
Next Steps,"Maybe if I had a plan or a specific route to take, it would help.  There’s a small park nearby that I like.  Sure, I could start by just walking around my block first before heading to the park. That sounds like a solid first step. How about setting a goal to walk around your block a few times this week? I think I can do that. I’ll try to go out in the mornings when it’s quieter. Maybe I could treat myself to a nice coffee afterward. I feel good about it. It feels achievable. Yes, I want to make it a non-negotiable part of my mornings. I usually do it around 7 a.m. so I could keep that time. I’d like to talk about my progress with going out and how it’s affecting my anxiety levels."
