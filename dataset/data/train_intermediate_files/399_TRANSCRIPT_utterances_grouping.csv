Trauma History,mm all the people i've hurt in the past like cheated on people hurt their feelings intentionally done things that i shouldn't have done that i regret now well with my ex i could've ended it better so we could be on better terms now um i probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things i probably should've just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer um well he had a tumor that he had to get removed so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there 'cause he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things i've done that i shouldn't have done all at one time how i've hurt people how i've hurt her the ways i've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once i reflected on it all
