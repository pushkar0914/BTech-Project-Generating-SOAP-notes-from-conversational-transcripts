History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been good, actually. I started that gratitude journal, and it’s been really helpful. I’ve been focusing on the little victories in my music and the good times with my friends. It’s nice to reflect on those moments. It feels rewarding. I didn’t realize how much I had to be grateful for until I started writing it down. I think I’m being kinder to myself. I’m not as harsh when I mess up. Not really. I just sometimes forget to write in it. Yes, I tried it a couple of times when I started feeling anxious about my music. It really helped! I felt a bit calmer and was able to focus better. I feel more present and less anxious. That was really helpful! I think it makes me second-guess my abilities sometimes. I worry that I’m not good enough to be a full member. Not really. I’m not sure how they’d react."

Therapeutic Interventions,I think I’d like to learn more about mindfulness and maybe some grounding techniques. Absolutely! Grounding techniques can be very effective. One simple method is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. Would you like to try it together? I’m glad to hear that! Practicing grounding techniques like this can help you in moments of anxiety. Would you like to incorporate this into your routine?
Next Steps,"Yeah, I think I’ll try to use it when I’m feeling overwhelmed, especially before performances. I think I could try. It might help to just get it off my chest. Absolutely! You deserve to feel secure in your contributions. How about setting a goal to have that conversation before our next session? Yeah, I’ll aim for that."
