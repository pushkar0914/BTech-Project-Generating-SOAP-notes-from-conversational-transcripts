History of Present Illness (HPI),"It was really nice. I painted a sunset, and it felt good to be creative again. I felt peaceful and focused. It was a nice escape from everything else. Yes, I felt lighter afterward. But then I had a couple of rough days again. I think it was just the job search again. I got a couple of rejections, and it hit me hard. I tried to remind myself that it’s part of the process, but it’s hard to stay positive. I haven’t really. I guess I just focus on the negatives. I’ve been thinking about my family a lot. I miss them. Just being around them, sharing moments. I wish I could see them more often."

Therapeutic Interventions,"It might help to create a list of things you’re proud of, even if they’re small. Would you be willing to try that? Great! You could write down your accomplishments in painting, attending the art exhibit, and even the effort you put into job applications. "

It could help bridge the distance and keep those relationships strong. Would you like to set a goal for that? Yes, I could try to call them once a week. That sounds like a wonderful goal. Let’s check in about how that goes in our next session.  Okay, I’ll do that."
