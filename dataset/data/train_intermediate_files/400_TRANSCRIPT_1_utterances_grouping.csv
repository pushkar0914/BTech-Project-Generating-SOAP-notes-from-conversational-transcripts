History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's understandable. Last time, you mentioned feeling better than you have in a long time. Do you still feel that way? Yeah, I do. The diet change has really helped. I feel clearer, you know? That's great to hear! Have you noticed any specific changes in your mood or interactions with others? Well, I think I've been less irritable, which is nice. I’m not snapping at people as much. That’s a positive step. You also mentioned feeling guilty about not supporting your friends. Have you had any opportunities to reach out to them? I haven’t really. I want to, but I guess I’m just nervous about it. It’s normal to feel nervous about reconnecting. What do you think is holding you back? I don’t know. Maybe it’s the fear of them not understanding where I’m at right now. Exactly! It’s about sharing your experience. Speaking of sharing, how do you feel about talking to me about your mom's passing? We didn’t get to delve into that last time. <sigh> I still feel pretty raw about it. Some days are harder than others. That’s completely understandable. Grief doesn’t follow a linear path. Are there specific moments that trigger those harder days? Sometimes it’s just random things, like a song or a place we used to go together. Those reminders can be tough. Have you found any coping strategies that help when those moments arise? I usually try to distract myself with something fun like cooking or watching a show. Those sound like healthy distractions. Have you thought about incorporating any rituals to honor her memory? I’m glad to hear that. It’s important to find ways to keep those memories alive. How about your temper? You mentioned struggling to control it sometimes. Have there been any situations recently where you felt that way? Yeah, I had a bit of a blow-up at work last week. It was embarrassing. It happens to everyone, but it’s good that you recognize it. What do you think triggered that reaction? I was just really stressed about deadlines, and then someone made a comment that rubbed me the wrong way."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Stress can definitely heighten our reactions. Have you considered any techniques for managing stress in those moments? I’ve tried deep breathing, but it’s hard to remember when I’m in the heat of the moment. It can be challenging. Maybe we could work on creating a quick grounding exercise you can use when you feel that tension rising. Would you be open to that? Sure, that sounds helpful. Great! Let’s brainstorm a few quick techniques. How about a simple five-second breathing exercise? Inhale for four seconds, hold for one, and exhale for four.  That sounds doable."
Next Steps,"Excellent! You could practice that a few times a day to help it become more automatic. Would you like to set a goal to try this technique over the next week? Yeah, I’ll give it a shot."
