History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's understandable. Last time we talked about some of the pressures you feel regarding your career and your studies. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke? Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about my grad school audition. It still bothers me. It sounds like that experience is weighing heavily on your mind. Can you tell me more about what specifically bothers you? I just keep replaying it in my head, like what I could have done differently. I feel like I let myself down. It’s common to ruminate on past experiences, especially those that feel significant. What do you think you could have done differently? I could have practiced more. I could have been more confident. I just... I don’t know, I feel like I choked. It’s tough when we feel like we haven’t met our own expectations. How do you typically cope with feelings of disappointment? I usually just push through it, you know? I throw myself into my work. That makes sense. Sometimes throwing ourselves into work can be a way to distract from those feelings. How has that worked for you? Well, it helps for a bit, but then I just feel exhausted and still think about the audition. It sounds like it might be a temporary fix. Have you considered other ways to process those feelings, perhaps through mindfulness or self-compassion exercises? It’s hard not to judge it. I just feel like I should be over it by now. I feel a bit lighter, actually. Like it’s okay to not have it all figured out. I’ve been thinking about my sleep issues too. It’s still a struggle. Sleep is crucial for our overall well-being. What do you think is keeping you from getting a good night’s sleep? My mind just races. I think about everything I have to do. It sounds overwhelming. Have you tried any techniques to calm your mind before bed?"

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s fair. It can feel a bit foreign at first. Would you be open to trying a simple exercise together now? Sure, I’m willing to give it a shot. Great! Let’s start with a simple breathing exercise. Take a deep breath in... and out. Focus on how your body feels as you breathe.  Okay... I’m doing it. Good. Now, as you breathe, think about the pressure you feel regarding your audition. Acknowledge it without judgment.  That’s a common habit. Sometimes screens can actually keep our minds active. Would you be willing to explore some alternatives to that? Sure, what do you suggest? You might try reading a book or listening to calming music. You could also try a relaxation technique, like progressive muscle relaxation. It involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body. It helps release tension and can promote better sleep. Would you like to try that together? Yeah, let’s do it."
Next Steps,"That’s a wonderful realization. What might be a small step you could take to continue this process of self-compassion? Maybe I could write about my feelings?  Writing can be a powerful tool for processing emotions. Would you be open to setting some time aside this week to do that? Yeah, I can do that."
