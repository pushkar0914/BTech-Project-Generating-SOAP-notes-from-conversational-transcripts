Next Steps,"Maybe I could send them letters or little care packages. I could send them some of their favorite snacks or little toys.  They’d probably be excited. I know they love surprises. It sounds like this could be a great way to strengthen your bond. Would you like to set a goal around sending them something this week? Yes, I’d like to do that. That’s wonderful! Let’s say you aim to send a care package by the end of the week. Does that work for you? Yes, that sounds good."
