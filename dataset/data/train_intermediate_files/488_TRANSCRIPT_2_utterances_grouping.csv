History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay. I’ve been trying to practice the reframing and mindfulness exercises.   I think it’s helped a bit, but I still find myself slipping back into negative thoughts sometimes.   Well, I was waiting to hear back from a job application, and I started thinking I wouldn’t get it. But then I reminded myself of what we discussed and reframed it to, “I’ve done my best, and I’ll hear back when I hear back.”   It made me feel a bit more at ease, actually.   I did get an interview for one position!   I’m excited but also really nervous.   I can be disorganized at times, but I’m working on it by using planners and reminders.   I feel a bit more confident.   I’ve been thinking about my relationship with my boyfriend.   I feel like we’re not communicating as well lately, especially about my job search.   I think he gets frustrated when I talk about my anxiety, and I don’t want to burden him.   Not really. I just try to keep it to myself.   I’d say, “Hey, I’ve been feeling anxious about my job search, and I want to share that with you, but I don’t want to overwhelm you.”   I hope he’d be understanding, but I’m not sure.  "
