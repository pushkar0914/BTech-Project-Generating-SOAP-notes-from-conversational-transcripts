History of Present Illness (HPI),"I don’t know. I just kept thinking about how I didn’t have the energy to start. Mostly downs, to be honest. I still feel really tired and unmotivated. Just the usual money worries and feeling alone, I guess. I did a little bit. I wrote down my essentials, but I’m still worried about how to manage everything. Yeah, I think that could help. I just feel stuck."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s understandable. Sometimes just starting can feel like a big hurdle. Would it help if we set a very small goal for crocheting, like just picking up the yarn for a few minutes? Yeah, I think I could do that. Just picking it up seems easier. That can be tough. Sometimes just having someone to talk to can help lighten the load a bit. Would you be open to exploring ways to connect with others, even if it’s just online or through a group? That’s okay! We can explore some options together. There are online forums and support groups where people share similar experiences. It could be a safe space for you to connect with others. That’s a great start! Acknowledging your expenses is an important step. Would it help if we brainstormed some potential ways to increase your income or cut back on non-essential expenses? That’s a fantastic idea! Freelancing could not only provide some extra income but also help you connect with others. Would you be willing to explore that option?"
Next Steps,"That’s the spirit! It’s all about taking small steps that can lead to bigger changes. Let’s also set a couple of goals for this week. Perhaps you can try crocheting for a few minutes and researching freelance opportunities? Yeah, I can do that."
