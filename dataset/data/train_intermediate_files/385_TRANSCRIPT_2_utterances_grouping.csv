History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been okay. I reached out to my friends, but we haven’t made plans yet. It felt a bit weird, but okay.  A little. I hope they want to. I think I feel a bit better.  Maybe just talking about things?  I’ve been trying to focus on what makes me happy. Yeah, I saw someone being rude in public. I just ignored it. I’d tell them to be nicer. Maybe. I don’t want to confront anyone."
