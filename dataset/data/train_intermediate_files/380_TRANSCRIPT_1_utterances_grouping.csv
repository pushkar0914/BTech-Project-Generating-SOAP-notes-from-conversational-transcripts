History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, I guess. Still getting used to everything in L.A.   Yeah, definitely. Meeting new people is tough. I still feel a bit isolated.   A couple, but it’s hard to break the ice. I feel shy, and I don’t want to come off as awkward.   I could try, but I worry I’ll just freeze up.   Yes, I found a new place! It’s much nicer, and I think it’ll help my mood.   I hope so. I feel like I might be able to breathe a little easier there.   It’s still tough. I’ve applied to a few places, but I haven’t heard back from anyone yet.   I just feel like I can’t express myself well in social situations.   Probably fear of judgment. I worry about what people will think of me.   Actually, yes! At a film festival last year, I felt really engaged.   I was surrounded by people who shared my passion, and it felt like a safe space.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,One approach is to practice small talk. It can be as simple as commenting on the weather or asking about someone’s interests. Do you think you could try that?   Networking can be a great way to find opportunities. Maybe you can attend some local film events or workshops?   That’s a common concern. One way to challenge that fear is to remind yourself that everyone has insecurities.   That’s a key insight. Seeking out environments where you feel comfortable can help reduce anxiety.  
Next Steps,"It’s completely normal to feel that way. What if you set a small goal, like initiating one conversation a week?   That sounds like a good idea. I’ll look into it.   How about we set a goal for this week? Perhaps you can look for a local film event to attend?  "
