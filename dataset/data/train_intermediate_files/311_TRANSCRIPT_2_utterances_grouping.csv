History of Present Illness (HPI),"I think I’ve been handling my frustration better. I didn’t yell at my neighbor this time! I approached them calmly and said I was feeling overwhelmed by the noise. They actually apologized! I felt relieved. It was nice to communicate without fighting. I learned that talking things out can be better than avoiding them. It felt good to express myself. Well, I still have moments of sadness. It’s like a wave that comes and goes. That’s understandable, especially with your history of depression. Have you noticed any specific triggers for those waves of sadness? I try to distract myself with my dogs or watching a movie, but it doesn’t always work."
