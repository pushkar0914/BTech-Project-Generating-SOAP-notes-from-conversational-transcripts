History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, just dealing with some ups and downs. Can you tell me more about the ups and downs? Well, I had a good visit with my son last week, but I’m still feeling stressed about his situation. It was nice to see him doing well, but I also felt a lot of guilt about his situation. I try to keep busy with my jewelry design, but sometimes it just creeps back in. I think when I’m creating, I can lose myself in the process. But then I feel guilty for enjoying it. I know I should, but it feels selfish sometimes. I see your point. I guess I just worry about what others might think. It makes me hesitate to do things for myself. I feel like I should always put my kids first. I think it would help me feel more centered. Just my husband and I have had some tension lately. It’s the same old issues—communication and feeling disconnected. We’ve tried, but it usually ends up in the same cycle of misunderstandings. I want to tell him that I feel overwhelmed and need his support. I feel more hopeful about managing things."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One approach is using “I” statements. For example, instead of saying “You never listen,” you could say “I feel unheard when you don’t respond.”"
Next Steps,"Maybe I could set aside a few hours a week just for my jewelry. How about Saturday mornings? I usually have a bit of quiet then. I’ve been thinking about journaling my thoughts and feelings. I think it might help me process my emotions better. Yes, I could try to write a few times a week. That could be helpful, I think. I think I’ll wait for a calm moment and just be honest."
