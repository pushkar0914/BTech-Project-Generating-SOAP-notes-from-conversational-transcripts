History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been tough. Some days are better than others. I try to stay positive, but it wears on you, you know?   Sometimes I think about my dad a lot, and it makes me anxious. I worry about what will happen next.   It makes me feel helpless sometimes. I want to support him, but it’s hard when he shuts me out.   I feel scared and sad, honestly. It’s hard to watch him go through this.   I do, mostly. I think they understand, but sometimes I don’t want to burden them.   Yeah, I guess I just don’t want to seem like I’m complaining all the time.   They’ve been pretty much the same. Still those stress dreams, mostly about my dad.   Not really, but I think they come when I’m feeling particularly anxious or overwhelmed.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Well, I’ve been trying to meditate a bit more. It helps me calm down when I feel overwhelmed.   I’ve thought about writing him a letter. I could say everything I want to without putting him on the spot.   Sure! I want to tell him how much I love him and how I’m here for him no matter what.   I’ve been trying to write them down when I wake up. It helps to get them out of my head.   Maybe some relaxation techniques? I could use some more tools to help me unwind.   It involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body. It can help alleviate physical tension and promote relaxation.   Great! Let’s practice it together. You can start by taking a deep breath in… and as you exhale, let your shoulders drop.   Wonderful! You can practice this technique whenever you feel tension building. It’s a great way to reconnect with your body.  "
Next Steps,I’d like to write that letter to my dad and practice some of the relaxation techniques we discussed.
