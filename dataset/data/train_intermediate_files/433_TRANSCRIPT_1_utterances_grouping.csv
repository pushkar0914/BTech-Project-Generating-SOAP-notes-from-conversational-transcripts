History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been therapeutic, honestly. I get to focus on something I love, and it helps me clear my mind. I’m glad to hear that. You mentioned that you sometimes feel guilty about past wrongdoings. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke? Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it. I guess I just wish I could go back and fix some things. Maybe I wouldn’t have gotten into trouble with traffic violations. I feel like it affected my life a lot. I feel frustrated and a bit ashamed, like I let myself down. I try to distract myself by working on my car or spending time with family, but sometimes it creeps back in. I try to stay calm, but sometimes I just want to raise my voice and get my point across. I’ve been thinking about my future and my dreams, like owning my own shop. "

Psychosocial History,"Not really, just the usual. Still working on my car, and spending time with my wife and kids. Perfect. Let’s also talk about your relationship with your wife. You mentioned some disagreements last time. How has that been lately? We’ve had a couple of arguments about small things, but nothing major."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That makes sense. We can explore more effective coping strategies together. Would you be open to trying some mindfulness techniques? Great! Mindfulness can help ground you in the present and reduce feelings of guilt. Let’s start with a simple breathing exercise.  Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this together a few times. That’s a great idea. Maybe you could use “I” statements to express how you feel instead of focusing on what she’s doing wrong. For example, saying “I feel frustrated when…” instead of “You never…”"
Next Steps,"That’s wonderful. Practicing this regularly can help bring you back to a calmer state when you feel overwhelmed. Would you be willing to try this at home? I guess I could try to express my feelings before it escalates. I guess I could start saving money and maybe look into some business classes. Those are great first steps! Setting small, achievable goals can help you feel more motivated. How about we set a goal for you to research a local business class by our next session?"
