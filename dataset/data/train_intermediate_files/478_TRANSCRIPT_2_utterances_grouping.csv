Progress Evaluation,"I think I’m becoming more comfortable with the idea of socializing. It’s still a bit daunting, but I feel more prepared. I feel proud. I’ve been pushing myself out of my comfort zone, and it’s nice to see some positive results. Just the usual deadlines, but I’m handling them better than I used to."
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,I’ve been practicing my breathing exercises and reminding myself that it’s okay to feel nervous.
Next Steps,I’d like to continue being proactive about socializing and maybe try to join a class or group. I’m thinking about a cooking class or maybe a hiking group. I’d like to look into classes this week and see what’s available.
