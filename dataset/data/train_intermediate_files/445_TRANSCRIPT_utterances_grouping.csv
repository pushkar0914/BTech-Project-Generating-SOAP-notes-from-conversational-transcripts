Trauma History,being in galena alaska and being on a small airplane and traveling in a snow storm and surviving like i was on the edge of death and life but i lived well when i was taking care of my mother and she was dying of c_o_p_d and then it turned into lung cancer i chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful and i had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but i couldn't tell her the truth and i let her think that everything was okay my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and me seeing her health decline that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better
