Medical and Psychiatric History,no well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h this is going back about six months ago advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist i didn't follow that but uh i think i might have a you know a mild case of depression
Psychosocial History,i'm from uh l_a i like the weather i like the sports teams i like the entertainment uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it but uh overall it's okay uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter> that's why that's my that was my major yeah i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um you didn't see you know too many computers around back then and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much open up too much so i have to like back off you know but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um it's just me and my uncle and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida so uh we're we're okay uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep and uh he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters giving out really nice samples it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like have me experience their product or service i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh about a month ago i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh i i like to be conscientious i i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic pretty calm for the most part you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game uh go to a movie go out with some friends you know earning earning money on the weekends i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really
