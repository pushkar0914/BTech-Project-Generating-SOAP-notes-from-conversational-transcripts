History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been okay. I’ve been trying to practice mindfulness, like we talked about. I’ve been doing it most mornings, and it helps set a better tone for my day. That’s great to hear! Have you noticed any changes in your anxiety levels since starting this practice? I think so. I feel a bit more grounded and less reactive to stress. That’s wonderful progress! What situations have you noticed it helping you with the most? Mostly when I’m feeling overwhelmed at work or when I’m out in public. Those are significant triggers. It sounds like you’re really using the tools we’ve discussed. Have you had any challenges with the practice? Sometimes I forget to do it, especially on busy days.  I guess I’m still feeling unsure about whether it’s the right fit for me. We’ve been doing well! We’ve been more open with each other, and it feels good. We’re not just talking about problems; we’re also sharing positive things and making plans together. It makes me feel really happy and secure in our relationship. We talked about going on a trip together, which we’re both excited about. We’re thinking about a weekend getaway to the beach. We want to relax, maybe do some hiking, and just enjoy each other’s company. I’m excited! It’ll be nice to take a break from everything. I’d love to go for a sunset walk on the beach and maybe try some local food."

Next Steps,"Yeah, I could set an alarm on my phone. I found a couple of workshops that I’m interested in, but I haven’t signed up yet. Maybe I could reach out to the organizers and ask questions about what to expect. I think I’ll do that.  Great! Let’s set a timeline for that. How about aiming to reach out by the end of this week? That works for me.  I’m so glad to hear that! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate these changes. Let’s touch base again next week and see how everything is going."
