History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, I guess. Just trying to adjust to the new job.   It’s definitely different. I feel a bit out of my element, but I think it’s getting better.   Well, the pace is faster, and I feel like I need to prove myself more.   It felt really good. Like, maybe I do belong here after all.   I think my mind races with thoughts about work sometimes.  "
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"A couple of people have been friendly, which is nice.   I’ve been thinking about my family and how we don’t talk as often as I’d like.   I just wish we were closer and communicated more regularly.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to take breaks and go for walks during lunch. It helps clear my head.   Maybe just reminding myself that everyone was new once.   I’ve been listening to calming music, which helps a bit.  "
Next Steps,"Yeah, maybe I can do it every night before bed.   Great! We can brainstorm some ideas for reaching out and building those relationships.   I’m glad! Let’s make that a goal for our next session. How does that sound?   Excellent. Remember to practice your breathing exercise, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.  "
