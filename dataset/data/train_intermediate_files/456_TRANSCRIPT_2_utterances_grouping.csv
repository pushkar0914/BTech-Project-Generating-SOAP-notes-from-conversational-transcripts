History of Present Illness (HPI),"I went! I just observed, but it was really inspiring. Yes! Listening to their stories made me think about my own experiences in a new light. I’ve started drafting a new piece based on some of the prompts they provided.  It’s still there sometimes, but I’ve been trying to reframe my thoughts like we discussed. Absolutely! I often draw from my experiences with them in my stories."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"It’s been good! I talked to my brother the other day, and we had a nice chat. I’m thinking about going back for the holidays! I can’t wait to see my niece. Yes, it really is. I feel so lucky to have them in my life."

Mental Health Observations,"It felt good to be around other writers. I felt a bit nervous at first, but everyone was really welcoming. It feels amazing! I forgot how much I enjoy it when I’m in the zone. I think I’m starting to feel a bit more confident. I remind myself that it’s a process. I appreciate that. I feel like I’m slowly learning to be kinder to myself. I always feel supported and loved. It helps lift my spirits. I agree. It makes the writing feel more authentic."

Next Steps,"I want to finish the first draft of that new piece by the end of the week. I think I’ll share my progress with a friend who writes too.  Yes, I think it’ll help keep me on track. Maybe I can reward myself after I finish writing sessions, like treating myself to a nice coffee or something. I’ll definitely try that."
