History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, I’ve been okay, I guess. Tried to keep up with the journaling you suggested. It was a little hard at first, but I started writing down some moments where I felt good about myself. Well, I realized there were times I helped someone or did something nice for myself. Yeah, a bit. It felt good to remember those times. I had a couple of rough days. I felt really low. I saw some old friends hanging out online, and it made me feel lonely. Still nothing. I’m starting to feel hopeless about it. I looked into a few, but I didn’t sign up yet. I guess I’m just nervous about meeting new people."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s fantastic to hear! As you continue, try to add more details about how you felt during those moments. It can reinforce those positive feelings. That’s a common feeling. It can be intimidating to step outside your comfort zone. What if you approached it as a chance to enjoy something you love rather than focusing on the social aspect?"
Next Steps,"Networking can often lead to opportunities. Even reaching out to former colleagues or friends can open doors. Would you be willing to try that this week? Yeah, I could give that a shot. Exactly! Focusing on the activity can ease the pressure. Would you like to set a goal to sign up for a class this week? Yeah, I think I can do that."
