History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, actually. I had a bit of a rough patch with my family. We had a disagreement about my plans for the future. They want me to focus on a stable job, something more conventional, while I want to pursue my dream of starting a record label. Frustrated, mostly. I mean, I get where they're coming from, but I also feel like I need to follow my passion. I tried, but it didn't go well. They just kept insisting that I need to be practical. Exactly! It's about growth. Speaking of growth, how have you been managing your PTSD symptoms since we last spoke? Sometimes, when I'm reminded of my past, I still get those anxious feelings. It’s hard to shake them off."

Risk Assessment,"A bit nervous, honestly. What if he says no or thinks I'm not serious?"
Mental Health Observations,Nothing reported

Current Functional Status,"I've been trying to use some of the coping strategies we discussed, like stepping back before reacting. It feels empowering, like I’m starting to gain control over my emotions. A little bit. I’ve been trying to focus on my breathing, but it’s not always easy. A little calmer, actually. It helps to focus on something simple."
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,"Yeah, actually. I’ve been more aware of my triggers and have been able to avoid some conflicts."
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"Breathing exercises can be really helpful. Would you like to try a brief grounding exercise together now? Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times."
Next Steps,"I think I need to show them that I can make it work. Maybe if I had a solid plan or something to present to them. I could start by researching the industry more, maybe even finding a mentor or someone who's done it before. There’s a local producer I know. He seems pretty well-connected, and I think he’d be open to helping out. I think I just want to keep working on my goals and maybe find ways to manage my anxiety better. That sounds like a solid plan. For next time, how about we focus on creating that action plan for your record label and explore more coping strategies for anxiety?"
