History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's great to hear! Last time, you mentioned feeling a lot better since you started going to church. Have you continued with that?   Yeah, I've been going regularly. It really helps me feel grounded.   Definitely. It’s like therapy for me.   Yeah, I think I will. It helps me focus and forget about other worries.   That’s a great strategy. You also mentioned feeling anxious about the world and your children’s future. How has that been for you lately?   It still weighs on my mind sometimes, but I’m trying to stay positive.   I try to pray and meditate when I feel overwhelmed.   It helps me calm down and focus on the present.   I feel proud, but sometimes I worry if I’m doing enough.   I think being there for your kids and teaching them right from wrong is important.   Sometimes, but I think I could use more help.   Maybe just talking to other parents or finding a group to join.   Yeah, I think it would help me feel less alone in it.  "

Psychosocial History,"I like the sense of community and the messages. They give me hope and encouragement.   A few, yeah. I’ve met some nice people who share similar values.   I feel good about them. It's nice to be around people who understand what I'm going through.  "
