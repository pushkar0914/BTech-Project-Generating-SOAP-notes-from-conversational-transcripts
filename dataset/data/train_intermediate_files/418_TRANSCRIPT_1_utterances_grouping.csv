History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, I've been okay, just trying to manage the stress from the move and everything. I remember you mentioned feeling anxious about the expenses involved. Have you found any coping strategies that help? A little bit. I’ve been trying to stick to a budget and keep track of my spending, but it’s still overwhelming sometimes. It feels good, but then I worry about unexpected expenses popping up. That’s understandable. It’s hard to feel secure when there are so many variables. Have you had any unexpected expenses since we last spoke? Yes, I had to buy a new couch because the old one was falling apart. It was more expensive than I planned. I think so. It distracts me from my worries, and sometimes I think about the characters and their struggles, which makes me reflect on my own life. I was thinking about the characters’ fears and how they dealt with them. It reminded me of how I’ve been trying to face my own fears, like the anxiety around money. I’ve been considering looking for a part-time job, but I’m worried about managing my time and energy with my health issues. I’ve looked at a few job boards, but I haven’t applied to anything yet. I guess I’m just hesitant."

Risk Assessment,"I guess the fear of not being able to provide for myself or my kids. It’s always in the back of my mind. I think it’s the fear of rejection and not being good enough. I haven’t worked for a while, and I worry I won’t measure up."
Mental Health Observations,"I felt frustrated, but I tried to remind myself that it’s just a part of life. I didn’t want to let it ruin my day. I was on the edge of my seat! It was exciting, but I also felt a bit anxious afterward."
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,"I’ve been listening to more music and watching some horror movies, which helps me relax."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Those feelings are valid. It can be hard to put ourselves out there. What if we explored some affirmations or self-compassion techniques to help combat those thoughts? Let’s start with an affirmation. How about something like, “I am capable and deserving of opportunities”? Would you be willing to try repeating that? Great! We can also work on a self-compassion exercise. Whenever you notice those critical thoughts, try to acknowledge them and respond with kindness, as if you were speaking to a friend."
Next Steps,"Ideally, I’d find something flexible that allows me to work from home. That way, I could manage my time better. It’s a common struggle. Remember that it’s okay to be imperfect. We all have our challenges. How do you feel about setting a small goal for the week, like applying for one job? I think I can do that. Just one application feels more manageable."
