History of Present Illness (HPI),"I appreciate your honesty. Last time, we talked about some feelings of guilt regarding your friendships. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke? Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it. I still feel like I could do more for my friends, but I don't know what exactly. That’s understandable. It sounds like you’re feeling a sense of responsibility towards them. Can you think of a specific situation where you felt you could have helped a friend? Well, my friend was going through a tough time recently, and I wanted to reach out, but I didn’t know what to say. So I just didn’t. It can be really tough to find the right words. What held you back from reaching out? I guess I was afraid I wouldn't say the right thing or that I’d make it worse. That fear is quite common. What do you think could be a small step you could take to reach out next time? Maybe just sending a text to check in, even if I don’t know what to say. Great! Building on that, how do you feel about your own support system? Do you have people you can reach out to? It sounds like there might be a bit of distance there. What do you think is keeping you from connecting with them more deeply? I think I’m just not used to opening up. It’s hard for me to share my feelings. Exactly! It can be a safe space to explore your feelings. Let’s talk about how you felt during our last session. You mentioned feeling down. Have you noticed any changes in your mood since then? I’ve had some good days and some bad days. I think it’s just the usual ups and downs. That’s completely normal. Have there been any specific triggers for those down days? Sometimes I just feel overwhelmed with everything, like work and my relationships. It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure. Have you found any coping strategies that help during those overwhelming times? I try to play music, but sometimes it doesn’t help. I just end up feeling more isolated."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I guess I could try. Maybe writing things down first might help. Writing can be a powerful tool for self-expression. You could write letters to your friends, even if you don’t send them. How does that sound? That sounds like a good idea. I could get my thoughts out without the pressure of having to say them face-to-face. Music can be a double-edged sword sometimes. Would you be open to trying some mindfulness techniques to help with those overwhelming feelings? Mindfulness can include practices like deep breathing, meditation, or even just being present in the moment. Would you like to try a simple breathing exercise together?"
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that! It’s a simple way to center yourself when things feel overwhelming. How do you think you could incorporate that into your routine? Maybe I could do it in the morning or when I start feeling stressed. That’s a wonderful idea! It can set a positive tone for your day. As we wrap up today, what’s one goal you’d like to focus on for our next session? I think I’d like to work on reaching out to a friend and maybe trying that breathing exercise more regularly."
