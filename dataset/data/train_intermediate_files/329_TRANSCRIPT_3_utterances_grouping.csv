History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been really good. I practiced saying no a couple of times, and it felt great!   Sure! I told a friend I couldn’t make it to an event, and they were really understanding.   It felt empowering. I realized I don’t have to please everyone all the time.   It made me feel more connected to myself and others. I found it really soothing.   I often find myself working late, and it cuts into my personal time.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to reframe my thoughts, like reminding myself that I’m allowed to take care of myself.   I tried a new technique called loving-kindness meditation, and I really liked it.  "
Next Steps,"Yes, I think I’ll do that!   It’s understandable to feel that way, but setting boundaries can actually enhance your productivity. How about we set a goal for you to establish a work cut-off time this week?   That sounds like a good idea. I’ll try to stop working by 6 PM.  "
