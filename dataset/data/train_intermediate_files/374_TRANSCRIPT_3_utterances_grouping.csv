History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! It’s been a bit better, actually. I’ve been trying to focus on the things we discussed. I kept a sleep journal, and I’ve been writing more. It’s helped me process some of my feelings. I actually got a response from one of the places I applied to! They want to interview me! It’s been therapeutic. I’ve been writing about my feelings around the job search and my experiences with rejection."

Therapeutic Interventions,I think practicing answers to common interview questions might help. And maybe doing some deep breathing beforehand.
Next Steps,"I think I need to be more mindful about my job search, maybe set specific times to work on it instead of letting it consume my day. I could remind myself of my strengths and accomplishments, like we talked about. Maybe even write those down and keep them visible. I’ll make a list and put it on my fridge or something. Perfect! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your goals for the upcoming week. You’ll prepare for your interview, continue your writing, practice deep breathing, and create a visible reminder of your strengths. Sound good?"
