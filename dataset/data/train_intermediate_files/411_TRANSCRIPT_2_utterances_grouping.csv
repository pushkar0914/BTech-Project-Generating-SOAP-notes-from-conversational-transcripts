History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been pretty good. I’ve been trying to stick to my meditation and yoga goals. I’ve been able to meditate almost every morning, and I did a couple of yoga sessions at home. I feel more centered. Yes, I feel less anxious and more at peace. It’s like I’m able to handle challenges better. Sometimes I struggle to find time, especially on busier days. But I remind myself that even a few minutes can help. Definitely. The other day, I had a stressful meeting at work, and I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself to stay present. It really helped. I had a family gathering that made me a bit anxious. There were a lot of people, and I felt a bit out of place."

Mental Health Observations,I think I’m more aware of my emotions and can identify when I’m feeling overwhelmed. I try to take a step back and breathe. I tried to focus on my breathing and remind myself that it was okay to feel uncomfortable. I also stepped outside for a few moments to regroup. I think I’m learning to accept that it’s okay to feel anxious sometimes. I won’t let it stop me from attending.

Therapeutic Interventions,"Journaling can be a powerful tool for processing emotions and thoughts. It allows you to express yourself freely without judgment. You can write about your feelings, daily experiences, or even gratitude lists. Wonderful! We can also explore other techniques, like deep breathing exercises or grounding techniques, if you’re interested. Alright! The idea is to engage your senses. You start by identifying five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This helps anchor you in the present."
Next Steps,"Absolutely! It can also serve as a reflection tool to track your progress over time. Would you be willing to give it a try? Yes, I’ll give it a shot. I think it could be beneficial. I’d love to learn more about grounding techniques. I think they could help me in stressful situations."
