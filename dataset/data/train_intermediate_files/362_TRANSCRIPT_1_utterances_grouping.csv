History of Present Illness (HPI),"It felt really refreshing. The fresh air and just being away from everything for a while helped clear my mind. I'm glad to hear that. You mentioned feeling run down last time. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels since then? I’ve done a little bit of meditation before, but I never really stuck with it. It was actually really calming. I felt more in control."

Next Steps,"Yes, I could try doing a short meditation before bed. That sounds like a good plan! How about starting with just five minutes each night? You could use a guided meditation app to help you. That sounds doable. I’ll give it a try. I think focusing on my meditation and using the grounding exercise when needed would be good."
