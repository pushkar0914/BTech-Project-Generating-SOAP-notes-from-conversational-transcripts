History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I enrolled in a few online courses, so that’s a step forward. They’re challenging, but I’m enjoying it. It feels good to learn again. I really like the creative projects. It gives me a chance to express myself. Yeah, I think so. It keeps my mind occupied, which is nice. Yeah, I had a small argument with my girlfriend last week over something silly. I felt my temper rising. I think it was just a combination of stress and feeling overwhelmed with everything I’m trying to manage."

Current Functional Status,"I’ve been trying to incorporate more music and relaxation time into my routine. Mostly Latin music, but I also like some chill playlists. They help me unwind. Maybe in the mornings before I start my day or in the evenings to wind down. I took a step back and told her I needed a moment to cool off.  She was understanding, which helped a lot. "
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,I think I could try to express when I’m feeling overwhelmed before it gets to that point.
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,We could start with some simple breathing exercises. They can help ground you when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to try that now? Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose… and out through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together. 
Next Steps,"Maybe I could set aside some time to talk with her about how I’m feeling. I want to continue focusing on my goals for school and managing my emotions better.  Great! I’m looking forward to our next session. Keep practicing those breathing exercises, and let’s check in on how they’re helping next time. "
