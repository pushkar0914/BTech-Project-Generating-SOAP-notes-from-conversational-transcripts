History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s a powerful feeling. Have you noticed any changes in your anxiety or feelings of overwhelm since implementing those strategies? A little. I still have moments of anxiety, but they don’t feel as overwhelming as before. I think I need to be more assertive. I sometimes feel bad saying no. I still worry about my career and what direction I want to go in. I hope to gain more confidence in my skills and maybe open up new job opportunities."

Current Functional Status,"I’ve tried to spend more time outside and not engage too much in her negative talk, but it’s hard to avoid it completely. I signed up for a course on digital marketing!

Therapeutic Interventions,"I did a bit of meditation each day, and I reached out to a friend to talk about how I was feeling. It’s understandable to feel that way. Remember, being assertive is about respecting both your needs and the other person’s. Would you like to practice some assertive communication techniques together? Maybe I could say something like, “I understand you’re frustrated, but I need to focus on my own well-being right now.” Yes, I’ve been doing five minutes of mindfulness each morning. It really helps ground me."
