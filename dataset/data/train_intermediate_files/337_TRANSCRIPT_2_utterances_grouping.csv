History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing a bit better. I reached out to a couple of people in the industry. Surprisingly well! One of them responded and invited me to a small gathering of performers next week. Honestly, I’m excited but also a bit anxious about meeting new people. I think I need to apply it to my creative work too. I often feel like everything has to be perfect before I share it."

Next Steps,"It can be! Maybe you could set a goal to share a piece of work with someone, even if it’s not finished. I could try that.  Excellent! Let’s aim for that as a goal for our next session.  Okay, I’ll work on it."
