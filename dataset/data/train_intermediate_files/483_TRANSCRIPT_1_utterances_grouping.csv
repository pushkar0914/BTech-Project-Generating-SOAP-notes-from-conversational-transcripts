History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’m glad to hear that. Last time, we talked a lot about your experiences with Katrina and your ex. Have you had any thoughts about those topics since we last spoke?   Yeah, I’ve thought about it a bit. I mean, it’s hard not to, right?   Absolutely. It’s a big part of your life. Did anything in particular stand out to you?   That’s a powerful insight. How do you feel those experiences have shaped your daily life now?   Well, with Katrina, I think I’m more anxious about things that could happen. Like, I always feel like I need to be prepared for the worst.   That makes sense. It sounds like a survival instinct. How does that anxiety manifest for you?   That sounds exhausting. Have you found any strategies that help you cope with that anxiety?   Not really. I mean, I try to distract myself with video games or books, but sometimes it just doesn’t work.   Excellent. Mindfulness can be a great tool for managing anxiety. How do you feel now after practicing that for a moment?   I feel a little lighter, actually.   I think I want to talk about my temper again. I’ve noticed I’ve been getting angry more easily lately.   That’s important to address. What do you think is triggering that anger?   I think it’s just frustration from everything. Like, I feel stuck in my life and it just bubbles over sometimes.   Feeling stuck can be really challenging. Have you thought about what you’d like to change in your life?   Yeah, I want to find a job that I actually enjoy, but I’m not sure what that is.   That’s a great goal. Exploring your interests and passions can help you find that path. What do you enjoy doing?   I like drawing and creating things, but I don’t know how to turn that into a job.  "

Mental Health Observations,"Good. As you breathe, try to notice how your body feels. Are there any areas of tension?   I feel tightness in my shoulders.  "
Physiological Observations,"Absolutely! It’s all about finding what works for you. Speaking of routines, how have you been sleeping lately?   Not great. I still feel like I’m sleeping too much, but I’m also tired a lot.   It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle of fatigue. Have you noticed any triggers that affect your sleep?   Sometimes it’s just my mind racing with thoughts. Other times, it’s just that I feel so drained from everything.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Distraction can be helpful, but it sounds like you might need some additional coping strategies. Would you be open to exploring some techniques together?   Great! One technique we can try is mindfulness. It helps ground you in the present moment. Have you ever practiced mindfulness before?   That’s okay! We can start simple. Let’s take a moment to focus on your breathing. Just inhale deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth.   Acknowledge that tension. With each breath, imagine it releasing. Inhale calm, exhale tension.   Great! One technique is to create a wind-down routine. This could include reading a book, listening to calming music, or practicing relaxation exercises.  "
Next Steps,"That’s wonderful to hear! Would you like to incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine?   Yeah, I think I could do that. It might help with the anxiety.   That’s understandable. Have you tried any techniques to calm your mind before bed?   That’s common, but it can actually disrupt your sleep. Would you be interested in exploring some bedtime routines?   Okay, I can try that. I do like reading.   Perfect! Let’s set a goal for you to try this routine for a week and see how it affects your sleep. How does that sound?   Sounds good! I’ll give it a shot.   That’s a start! Have you considered looking into fields that combine your interests, like graphic design or animation?   Starting from scratch can feel daunting, but remember, every expert was once a beginner. What if we set a goal for you to explore some options in those fields?   Yeah, I could do that. Maybe I’ll look into some classes or online tutorials.   That sounds like a fantastic plan! Let’s aim for you to research at least one option this week.  "
