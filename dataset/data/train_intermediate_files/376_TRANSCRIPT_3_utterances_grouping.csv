History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay, but I had a rough day yesterday. I just felt really overwhelmed with work again. It got to me more than usual. I had a deadline approaching, and I felt like I was drowning in tasks.  I tried to take a break and go for a walk, but I just ended up feeling more anxious. I think I was just too in my head about everything. I couldn’t clear my mind. I wrote it, and it was really cathartic. I felt a mix of sadness and relief. I did feel happy when I was hiking last weekend. It was a nice escape. I think it’s a combination of work stress and my grief. Sometimes I just snap at people. I tend to just let it out in the moment, which I regret later."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I haven’t, but that might help.  It could be a good way to ground yourself. Would you like to practice a quick breathing exercise together now? Sure, that sounds good. Okay, let’s take a deep breath in through your nose... hold it for a moment... and now exhale slowly through your mouth.  Great! Let’s do that a couple more times. Inhale... hold... and exhale.  That’s wonderful to hear. You can use that technique whenever you start to feel overwhelmed at work.  I’ve been trying to stick to my hiking and journaling. They both help. One option could be finding a physical outlet, like exercise or even hitting a pillow. It can help release pent-up energy. That sounds like a great plan! You could also try journaling your feelings when you’re angry to help process them. "
Next Steps,I’ll definitely try to remember that. It’s great that you were able to express those feelings. Have you thought about making it a regular practice? I think I might. It helped me process my emotions. I think so. I just need to keep reminding myself to use them. I like that idea. I could use my hiking time to let out some frustration. I’ll give that a shot.
