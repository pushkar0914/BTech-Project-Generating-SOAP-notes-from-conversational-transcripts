History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! It’s been a bit hectic, but I managed to have that conversation with my wife. It went better than I expected. She was supportive and understood where I was coming from. I explained my desire to improve my skills and how that would help our family. She even encouraged me to sign up for a class. Yes, I signed up for one on coding. I’m really excited about it! It feels empowering. I’m finally taking action instead of just thinking about it. I feel more motivated and less stressed. It’s nice to have something for myself. I’ve been thinking about my relationship with my parents again. I still feel a bit disconnected. I just wish I had a better relationship with them, but it feels like there’s a barrier. I’d like to reconnect and maybe understand why things are the way they are."

Current Functional Status,"I just started the introductory module. It’s challenging, but I’m enjoying it so far. I’ve been sticking to my plan of studying in the evenings, and it seems to be working out. She’s been okay with it. I make sure to spend quality time with her during the day. We’ve been going to the park more often, and I try to involve her in simple things at home, like cooking. She loves it! She gets so excited when she feels included."

Next Steps,"That’s a good idea. If I have planned family time, I can focus on my studies without feeling guilty. I could start with a simple text or call, just to check in and see how they’re doing. Yeah, I think I’ll try that. "
