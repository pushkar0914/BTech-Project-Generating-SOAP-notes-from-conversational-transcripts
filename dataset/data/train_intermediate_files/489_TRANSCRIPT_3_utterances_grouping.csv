Subsection,Grouped_Utterances
Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,I’d like to talk about setting boundaries. I sometimes feel overwhelmed with others’ expectations.
Trauma History,Nothing reported
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"I realized that a lot of them are based on assumptions rather than facts. It makes me feel like I have more control. I can challenge them instead of just accepting them. Yes, there was a situation where I thought my boss was upset with me, but I later found out it was about something else entirely. It felt relieving! I was worried for no reason. Mostly with work. I tend to take on more than I can handle because I don’t want to let anyone down."

Psychosocial History,Nothing reported
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,Nothing reported
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,Nothing reported

Progress Evaluation,"Hi Ellie! I’ve been doing well. I’ve been practicing the techniques we discussed. Definitely. I’m feeling less anxious overall, and I’m more present in my daily life. Thank you for helping me with this. I feel more equipped to handle these situations."
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been more mindful of my thoughts, and I started writing them down like you suggested. I think that would be helpful. I need to work on my assertiveness. Absolutely! We can role-play some scenarios if you’d like, or you can start by saying no to smaller requests. I’d like to try role-playing. That could help me feel more prepared. I could say something like, “I appreciate the offer, but I’m currently at capacity with my workload.”"
Next Steps,Alright! Remember to practice those techniques and boundaries. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session.
