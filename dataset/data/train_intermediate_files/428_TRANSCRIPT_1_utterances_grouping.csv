History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time, we talked about your family and how they’ve been a positive influence in your life. Have you had any family gatherings or events since we last spoke? Yeah, actually, we had a barbecue last weekend. It was fun, a lot of laughter and food. That sounds wonderful! How did you feel during that gathering? I felt really happy, just being around everyone. It’s nice to catch up with family. Music can really bring people together. Speaking of bringing people together, how has your relationship with your girlfriend been since our last talk? It’s been good! We’ve been spending more time together, just hanging out and playing games. That’s nice to hear. Have you had any disagreements or challenges recently? Not really, just the usual little things, but nothing major. It’s good that you’re able to manage those little disagreements. You mentioned wanting to start a new business. Have you taken any steps towards that since we last spoke? I’ve been thinking about it more. I’m planning to learn from my dad and maybe help him out at his shop. I feel pretty excited about it. I think it’ll be fun to work with my dad. That’s wonderful! It seems like you have a supportive environment to learn in. Have you thought about any challenges you might face while learning? Keeping busy can help. Have you noticed any moments where you’ve felt overwhelmed or anxious recently? I guess sometimes when I think about the future, it gets a bit overwhelming. That’s understandable. It’s common to feel that way when thinking about big changes. What specifically about the future feels overwhelming to you? Just the thought of having to find a stable job and making sure I’m doing well in life."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I usually just try to laugh it off or distract myself with something else. Not really, I just try to keep busy and not overthink things."
Next Steps,"Yeah, that might help. I guess I could start by focusing on learning at the shop first. That’s a great approach! Focusing on the present and taking small steps can alleviate some of that pressure. What’s one small step you could take this week? I could ask my dad to show me some basics about car repairs. That sounds like a perfect start! How do you feel about setting that as a goal for this week? I feel good about it! I think it’ll be fun."
