History of Present Illness (HPI),"It felt liberating to just focus on something creative without worrying about work. I was really proud of some of the shots I got. I felt excited and a bit nervous at first, but as I got into it, I felt more confident. It was nice to see my progress. Yeah, there were times when I felt stuck and unsure of what to capture.

Therapeutic Interventions,"I took a break and went for a walk. Sometimes stepping away helps clear my mind, and then I can come back with a fresh perspective. Definitely! It really helped me find new ideas when I returned."
Next Steps,"I’m looking at online courses in graphic design and maybe some workshops on photography techniques. I think I can manage it by dedicating a few hours on weekends. I’m excited to make it work. I hope to enhance my skills and maybe even find a new passion that I could turn into a side project or career. It’s a bit daunting, but I think if I take it step by step, it could lead to something great. I think I’m good for now. I just want to keep the momentum going with my projects. That’s a healthy mindset! Let’s set a goal for our next session. Maybe you can share a new project or the progress you’ve made on your courses? That sounds perfect! I’ll aim to have started at least one course by then."
