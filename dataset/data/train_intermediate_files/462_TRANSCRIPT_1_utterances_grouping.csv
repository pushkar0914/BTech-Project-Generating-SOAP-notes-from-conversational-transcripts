History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. Last time, we talked about your feelings regarding your family and your current challenges with your child. Have there been any developments in that area? Well, I had a meeting with my lawyer about the custody situation. It was stressful, but I felt good about advocating for myself. That sounds like a positive step. How did you feel during the meeting? I felt a mix of anxiety and determination. I was worried about how it would go, but I also felt empowered to speak up for what I believe is right for my son. That’s great to hear. It sounds like you’re finding your voice. Did you use any of the relaxation techniques we discussed last time before the meeting? I did! I took some time to meditate and just breathe. It helped me calm down a bit. Wonderful! Meditation can be a powerful tool. How did you feel afterward? That makes sense. Advocating for yourself can be draining. How are you coping with that exhaustion? That’s a good strategy. Animals can provide great emotional support. Have you noticed any changes in your mood since you’ve started focusing on self-care? A little, yeah. I feel lighter when I’m with them. But then I get hit with the reality of my situation, and it’s tough. It’s completely normal to feel that way. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. What do you think is contributing to the heaviness you feel? That’s a heavy burden to carry. Have you considered talking to someone else about your feelings, like a support group or a trusted friend? I’ve thought about it, but I’m not sure where to start. I don’t want to burden anyone. It’s understandable to feel that way, but remember that sharing can also lighten your load. Maybe you could start with a close friend or someone who has been through similar experiences? That’s a positive step. Building a support system can really help. How do you feel about your relationship with your friends lately? It’s a bit rocky, to be honest. I feel like I’ve been distant because I’m so consumed with everything going on. That’s common when we’re dealing with a lot. It can be hard to reach out. Is there a specific friend you feel comfortable reconnecting with? There’s one friend, Sarah. She’s always been there for me, but I haven’t talked to her in a while. Reaching out to Sarah could be a great way to reconnect and relieve some of that burden. How do you think she would react? I think she’d be supportive. She’s always been understanding about my struggles. That sounds good. I used to love running, but I haven’t done it in a while."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Mindfulness can be challenging, especially when your mind is racing. Would you like to try a guided mindfulness exercise together right now? Sure, that sounds good. Great! Let’s take a moment to close our eyes and take a deep breath in… and out. Focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.  Okay, I’m focusing. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to your breath. Let’s do this for a minute. <pause> It feels nice to just breathe and not think about everything. Exactly. This can be a powerful tool to help ground you during stressful moments. How do you feel now? A bit calmer. I like this. Perfect! We can also explore other techniques, like journaling or physical exercise, to help manage your feelings. "
Next Steps,"That’s encouraging. Maybe you could set a small goal to reach out to her this week?  Yeah, I think I can do that. Just a text to check in. That sounds like a manageable step. As we continue to explore your feelings about your family and your son, do you have any specific goals for our sessions moving forward? I want to work on managing my anxiety better and finding ways to cope with the stress of the custody battle. Those are excellent goals. We can definitely focus on anxiety management techniques. Have you tried any specific strategies for that yet? I’ve been trying to practice mindfulness, but it’s hard to stay focused. I’m glad! Practicing this regularly can help you build resilience against anxiety. Would you like to incorporate this into your routine? Yes, I think I will.  Running can be a great way to release pent-up energy and stress. Perhaps you could set a goal to start running again, even if it’s just for a short time? Yeah, I could start with a short jog. I do miss that feeling of freedom. That’s a great idea. Let’s set that as a goal for next week. How does that sound? Sounds doable.  Of course! I’m here to help. Let’s check in again next week and see how things are going.  Take care, and remember to reach out to Sarah."
