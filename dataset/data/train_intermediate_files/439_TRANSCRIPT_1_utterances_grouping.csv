Trauma History,"I’ve been thinking about my mom again. It’s been a while since I reflected on her passing. I just think about how she would have loved to see my sons grow up. I wish she could have been here for those moments. Yes, I try to carry her lessons with me. I just wish she could see how far we’ve come. It makes me feel proud and connected to her in a way. I want to make her proud."

History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, we had a bit of a breakthrough. I decided to sit down with him and talk about the construction issues more calmly. It went surprisingly well! I expressed my concerns without being accusatory, and he actually listened. I think I approached it from a place of wanting to work together rather than blaming him. I focused on finding solutions instead of just pointing out what went wrong. He was receptive. He admitted he should have listened to me and we came up with a plan to fix the issues together. It makes me feel relieved and hopeful. I really want us to be a team, especially as we navigate these home projects together. Hmm, I think with my sons. Sometimes I feel like they don’t open up to me as much as I’d like. I think they’re both busy with their lives and maybe they feel I won’t understand their struggles. Ah, the yo-yo dieting. I’ve been trying to be more mindful, but it’s still a struggle. I’ve tried keeping a food diary, but I tend to forget to write things down."

Next Steps,"I’d like to have at least one meaningful conversation with each of them this month. I want to ask them about their dreams and any challenges they’re facing. I want them to feel they can share anything with me. I think I’ll invite them for dinner and create a relaxed atmosphere. Maybe I can share a personal story to break the ice. That might work better for me. I’m always on my phone, so it would be easier to do it that way. I love walking, especially in nature. I’ve been meaning to explore some local parks. That sounds wonderful! How about setting a goal to walk in a new park once a week? I like that idea! It’ll give me something to look forward to. That’s a lovely idea. Maybe I can light a candle and share a story about her."
