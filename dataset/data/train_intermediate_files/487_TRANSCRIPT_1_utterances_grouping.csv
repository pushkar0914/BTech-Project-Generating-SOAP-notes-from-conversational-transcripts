History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been doing alright, thanks for asking. A bit busy with work, but managing. It's been a bit overwhelming at times, but I’ve been trying to stay organized.  It feels relieving, actually. I can prioritize better and it makes everything seem less daunting. I think my stress has decreased a little. I feel more in control. Yes, I went hiking last weekend and the view was breathtaking. It reminded me why I love being outdoors. It lifted my spirits. I felt so connected to nature, and it was a much-needed break from my routine. I’d like to! I think it would help me recharge. It usually involves reading, going for walks, and sometimes just taking a moment to breathe. Not as often as I’d like. I often push them aside for work."
