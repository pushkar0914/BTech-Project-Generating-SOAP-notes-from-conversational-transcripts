History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie! I’ve had a bit of a rough week. I tried writing about my feelings, but it brought up a lot of emotions. I wrote about my dad and how angry I still feel. It made me cry, and I didn’t expect that. I think I want to write about my relationship with my mom and how that impacts me. Yeah, I think it’ll help me understand why I react the way I do sometimes. I feel hopeful. I think we’re starting to communicate better. Yeah, I’ve been less reactive. I think the meditation is helping a lot. I guess I’m still worried about my dad. I don’t know if I should reach out to him. I haven’t really thought that far ahead. I just feel conflicted."
