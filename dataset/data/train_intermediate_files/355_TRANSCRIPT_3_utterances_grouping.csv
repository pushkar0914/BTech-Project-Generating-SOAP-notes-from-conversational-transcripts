History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I’ve been okay. I sent the message to my family. A bit nerve-wracking, but I felt relieved afterward. Yes, my mom replied. She was understanding and wants to talk. I’m a bit nervous, but I think it’ll be good to talk. It went really well! They mentioned a few job openings and offered to refer me. I sent a thank-you message, and they responded positively. I’ve tried a few mindfulness exercises, and they’ve helped."
