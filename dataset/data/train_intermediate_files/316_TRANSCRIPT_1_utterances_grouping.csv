History of Present Illness (HPI),"I'm glad you came in today. Can you tell me more about the ups and downs you've been experiencing? Well, I’ve had some good days where I feel motivated, but then there are days when I just feel really low and unmotivated again. That sounds challenging. What do you think triggers those low days? I think it’s mostly related to my job situation. I still haven’t found anything, and it just weighs on me sometimes. I felt good that I went, but I also felt a bit sad afterwards. Like, I should be doing more with my life. Yes, I guess I should focus on that more. It’s just hard to shake off the negative thoughts."

Psychosocial History,"I’ve been thinking about my mom a lot lately. It’s been tough without her. Sure. She loved to paint, and I remember watching her create these beautiful landscapes. It always made me feel at peace."

Current Functional Status,"Yes, I’ve been trying to push myself to get out more, but it’s hard. Some days I just want to stay in bed. I went to a local art exhibit last weekend. It was nice to be around art and people, but I felt a bit out of place."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve tried some breathing exercises, but I don’t always remember to do them when I need to. That’s a good start! Perhaps we can work on a reminder system or a mindfulness practice that fits into your daily routine. Would you be open to that? Great! What if we set a specific time each day for a short mindfulness exercise? It could be as simple as five minutes of focused breathing."
Next Steps,I could try that. Maybe in the morning before I start my day? I think it could help me start the day with a clearer mind. I’ll give it a shot. Maybe I could try painting again. I haven’t done that in years. That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in art could be a therapeutic outlet for you. How about we set a goal for you to paint something in the next week? Absolutely. I think it could be very healing. Let’s also explore how you feel after you paint in our next session.
