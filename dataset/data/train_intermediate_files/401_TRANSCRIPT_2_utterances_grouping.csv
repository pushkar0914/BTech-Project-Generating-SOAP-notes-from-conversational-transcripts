History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing well, actually. I cooked a couple of healthy meals like we talked about! It felt great! I made a stir-fry and a salad, and I enjoyed both. I forgot how much I like cooking. Not really. I’m trying to stay consistent, but sometimes I still feel the urge to eat out when I’m busy. I actually had a couple of auditions! They went okay, but I didn’t get a callback for either. I felt a bit disappointed, but I tried to remind myself that it’s part of the process. I try to talk to friends who understand what I’m going through. It helps to share my feelings. Sometimes I just take a break and do something else I enjoy, like going for a walk or listening to music."

Next Steps,"Great idea! Let’s set a goal for meal prepping this week. You could make a few extra portions to have on hand for when you’re busy. I can do that! I’ll try to set aside some time this weekend for meal prep. I’d like to focus on building my confidence for auditions. Maybe I could find a class or workshop to help with that. Yes, I’ll look into that. I think it would really help."
