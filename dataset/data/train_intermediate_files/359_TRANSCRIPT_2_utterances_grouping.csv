Trauma History,I wrote about my experiences with gambling and how it felt to lose everything. It was kind of cathartic.

History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie! I’ve actually been doing a bit better. I tried the free writing exercise you suggested. It felt really good to just let my thoughts flow. I didn’t worry about making it perfect, and I wrote for about fifteen minutes. It felt like I was releasing some pent-up emotions. I didn’t realize how much I needed to express that. I still have my off days, but I’m feeling a bit more hopeful, which is nice. Yeah, I’ve been trying to remind myself that everyone has their own battles. It’s still hard sometimes, but I’m working on it. Thanks, I appreciate that. I’m trying to be more understanding. Not really, just the usual stuff I see on the streets. But I’m trying to manage my reactions better."
