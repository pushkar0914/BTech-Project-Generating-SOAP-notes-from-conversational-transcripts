History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s wonderful! Engaging with others can be a big step forward. Did you feel any anxiety while waiting for the replies? A little bit. I kept checking my phone. I had a rough night where I kept waking up again. The nightmares were back. Yeah, I think I push people away because I’m afraid of getting hurt."

Current Functional Status,"Hey! I actually posted a comment on the forum. It felt a little scary, but I did it. It was nerve-wracking, but I felt proud after. I even got a couple of replies. I think it made me more withdrawn. I didn’t want to be around them, so I just stayed quiet. There’s a guy I play games with online. He seems nice, but I’m not sure how to start."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I used the grounding exercise you taught me. It helped me calm down a bit. Not really. I just try to distract myself with games or TV. One technique we can use is journaling. Writing about your feelings and experiences can sometimes help you process them. What do you think about writing down your thoughts after a nightmare? That’s understandable, but sometimes confronting those feelings can lead to healing. You could start by writing just a few sentences about how you felt during the nightmare. Would you be willing to give it a try? Great! You can also use the grounding exercise before bed to help set a calm mindset. How do you feel about incorporating that into your routine?"
Next Steps,Maybe I could try to let someone in little by little instead of pushing them away right away. I want to work on letting someone in and trying the journaling exercise.
