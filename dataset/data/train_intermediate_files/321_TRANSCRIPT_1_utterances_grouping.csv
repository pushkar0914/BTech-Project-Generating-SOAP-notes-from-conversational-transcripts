History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's a healthy approach. Last time, we talked about some of the challenges you've been facing, especially with your sleep and feelings of depression. Have you noticed any changes or patterns since then? Not really. My sleep is still pretty bad, and I still feel down a lot of the time. It’s been tough. I worry about her a lot, and I feel helpless sometimes."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I tried journaling a bit, but it felt a little forced. I don't know.  I tried it once, but my mind kept wandering. I found it hard to focus. That’s common, especially when starting out. It can be helpful to focus on your breath or even just to notice the sensations in your body. Would you like to try a short mindfulness exercise together now?"
Next Steps,"Absolutely. Would you like to set a goal for yourself to spend more time with her or engage in activities that bring you joy? Yes, I think that would be good for me. How about we aim for at least one fun activity with her each week?  That sounds doable! How about making a plan to set aside some time each week for those activities?  I can try to do that. Maybe one evening a week? I’m glad to hear that. Remember to practice the mindfulness techniques and to reach out to your daughter when you feel ready. "
