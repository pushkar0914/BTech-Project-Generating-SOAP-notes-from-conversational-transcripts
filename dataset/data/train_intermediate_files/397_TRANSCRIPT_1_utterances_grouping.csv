History of Present Illness (HPI),"I hope you feel better soon. Last time we talked about your relationship with your family and some of the challenges you've faced. Have you had any thoughts or feelings about that since we last spoke? Yeah, I've been thinking about my mom a lot. It’s been tough not being there for her when she needed me. It's understandable to have those feelings. You mentioned feeling guilty about that. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been reflecting on? I just wish I could have done more. She was always there for me, and I feel like I let her down. I think I could start by being more present with my daughters and granddaughters. I don’t want them to feel the same way I do. That’s wonderful! Shifting gears a bit, you mentioned your friend who is on life support. How has that situation affected you? It’s been hard. I keep thinking about how fragile life is. One moment you’re fine, and the next, everything changes. I’ve been listening to more music, trying to distract myself a bit.  Yeah, I think I need to understand why I was so rigid back then. "

Therapeutic Interventions,"It could be helpful to bring it up casually, maybe during a conversation about family traditions. Would you like to practice how you might approach that? Okay, imagine you’re sitting with your daughters. You might say, “I’ve been thinking about how important family is to me, and I’d love to have regular dinners together. What do you think?” "
Next Steps,"I could make more time for them, maybe set up regular family dinners or something. That’s a good idea! We could have a little music night. That’s a great insight. Understanding our past can help us grow. I look forward to diving into that with you next time. "
