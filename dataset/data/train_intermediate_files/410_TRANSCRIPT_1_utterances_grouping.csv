History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I’ve thought about it a lot. I still feel that guilt sometimes, but I try to focus on the good memories we had. Not really. I don’t want to burden anyone with my problems. I feel like I should just handle it myself. I haven’t thought about it, but maybe I should. I just don’t want to seem weak. I feel like I’m doing okay, but there are days when I feel overwhelmed. Like, I want to do everything right for my daughter. I think it’s just the pressure to provide for her and be a good role model. I want to make sure she has everything she needs. I guess it means showing her how to be strong and independent, but also how to be kind and caring."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Mindfulness can be as simple as taking a few moments each day to focus on your breath or to appreciate your surroundings. Would you be willing to try that this week? Yeah, I can give it a shot. I think it might help."
Next Steps,"Great! And remember, it doesn’t have to be long—just a few minutes can make a difference. How about we set a goal for you to practice mindfulness at least three times this week? That sounds doable! I’ll try to make it a routine."
