Next Steps,"Yeah, I could try to do it this weekend.  Probably the friend I mentioned last time. I think I’ll just send a text to check in. Maybe just something simple like, “Hey, how have you been?”  Maybe some journaling. I think writing about my day could help me process things better. I could try to do it a couple of times a week."
