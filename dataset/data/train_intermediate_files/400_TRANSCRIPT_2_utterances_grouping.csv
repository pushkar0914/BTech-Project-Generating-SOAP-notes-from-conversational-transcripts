History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay. I tried that breathing exercise you suggested. It was helpful. I used it a couple of times when I felt stressed, and it definitely calmed me down. Yeah, I think I’ve been more patient with my coworkers. They even commented on it! I’ve had a couple of moments, but I used the breathing technique, and it helped. Just the usual work stress. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed."

Therapeutic Interventions,That’s understandable. It can be challenging to open up. Perhaps you could share your cooking experience with someone close to you as a way to start the conversation. It could be about saying no to extra tasks when you’re already feeling overwhelmed or setting specific times to focus on your work without distractions.
Next Steps,I think I might. It could be nice to do that on special occasions. I like that idea. I’ll try to be more assertive about my limits. I think I want to keep working on reaching out to friends and trying to incorporate more of my mom’s recipes.
