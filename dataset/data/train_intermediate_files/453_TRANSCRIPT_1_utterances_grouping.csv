History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, a bit anxious, but I'm managing. It’s good to hear you’re managing. Last time, you mentioned feeling anxious and having dreams that felt very real. Have those dreams continued? Yes, they have. I had another one last night about fighting again. It’s like I can’t escape it. I was in the ring, and I was supposed to be coaching someone, but then I ended up fighting myself. It felt so intense, like I was really there. I think stress from work and trying to balance everything is affecting me. I feel like I’m always in fight-or-flight mode. Wonderful! You mentioned feeling anxious lately. Can you describe what those anxious moments feel like for you? It’s like my heart races, and I can't focus. Sometimes I feel like I’m on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. Awesome! Let’s also revisit your sleep issues. You mentioned having trouble sleeping. Have you made any changes since we last spoke?"
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I’ve been thinking about my family a lot. It’s hard to connect with them. I feel like I’m missing out on a lot because we’re all so scattered. It makes me sad. I’ve thought about organizing a family call or something, but I’m not sure how to approach it."

Current Functional Status,"I’ve been painting more, which helps a little. But when I’m busy, I forget to take those breaks. It feels freeing. I get lost in the colors and the strokes, and it takes my mind off everything else. A little more centered. It helps to focus on the present instead of getting lost in my thoughts. I’ve been trying to limit my screen time before bed, but it’s hard."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I try to breathe deeply or go for a walk. But sometimes it just lingers. Grounding techniques can be very helpful. They focus on bringing you back to the present moment. Would you like to try one together now? Great! Let’s try a simple one. Look around the room and name five things you can see. Excellent! Now, let’s move to four things you can touch. Perfect! Now three things you can hear. Yes, it is! And now, two things you can smell. Great job! And finally, one thing you can taste."
Next Steps,"That’s great to hear. Maybe we can look at incorporating more scheduled painting time into your week to help you unwind. How does that sound? I like that idea! I need to prioritize it more. I’m glad to hear that. Grounding exercises can be a great tool to use when anxiety arises. Do you think you could practice this technique at home? Yes, I think I can give it a try. Maybe some light reading or listening to soft music? Those sound like wonderful ideas. How about we set a goal for you to try that for a week and see how it affects your sleep? I can do that. I’ll try to read a little before bed. That sounds like a great idea! Maybe you could start by reaching out to one family member to gauge interest. Would you like to set that as a goal for this week? Yes, I think I’ll try that."
