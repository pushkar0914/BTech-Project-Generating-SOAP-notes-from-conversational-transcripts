History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! It was okay. I actually looked into a couple of internships! It felt good to take action. I found a couple of places that seem interesting. One is at a local elementary school, and the other is with a nonprofit that works with kids with special needs. I haven’t submitted anything yet, but I plan to this weekend. I guess I’m just nervous about the application process. I just worry that I won’t stand out or that they won’t want me. Well, I have my degree in child development, and I’ve worked with kids before in tutoring. It’s still the same, honestly. I haven’t talked to my roommates yet. I think I’m just overthinking it. I don’t want to hurt their feelings."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Exactly! Those experiences are what will set you apart. It might help to highlight those in your applications. Would you like to practice how to frame your experiences? Yeah, that could help. Let’s say you’re writing your cover letter. How would you describe your experience with tutoring? I’d say something like, “I have experience tutoring children in various subjects, which helped me develop my communication skills.” That’s a solid start! You can also emphasize your passion for working with children and your commitment to special education.  That’s understandable. It’s important to be kind, but it’s also important to express your needs. Would it help to practice that conversation again? Yes, I’d like that. Okay, let’s role-play. Start with how you’d greet them. “Hey, can we talk for a minute?” Perfect! Now, how would you express your feelings? “I’ve been feeling a bit lonely living here and would love to connect more.”"
Next Steps,I want to submit those internship applications and have a conversation with my roommates. Those are excellent goals! Let’s check in on your progress in our next session.
