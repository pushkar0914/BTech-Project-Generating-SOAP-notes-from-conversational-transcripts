Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily and sometimes as an adult i still get angry easily but i've gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly gosh i think one of the toughest <tough> hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years i would've wasted those last seven years of my life it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did emotionally good um i'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend
