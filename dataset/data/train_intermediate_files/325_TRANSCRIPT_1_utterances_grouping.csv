History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been okay, I guess. Still trying to figure things out after graduating.  A little. I applied to a couple of internships, but I haven’t heard back yet. It’s just frustrating because I feel like I’m not doing enough. I try to keep myself busy. I go hiking or spend time with friends, but sometimes it just feels overwhelming. I have, but I think my mind is just too busy at night. I’ve tried some deep breathing, but I often forget to do it when I’m feeling anxious. I’ve been feeling a bit down about my future. I thought graduating would feel like a big achievement, but now I just feel lost. Yeah, I guess I didn’t expect it to hit me like this. That’s true. I just wish I had a clearer path. I’d love to work in conservation or research, but I’m not sure how to get there."

Next Steps,"That sounds like a great mix! How about we set a goal for you to apply to at least one job or internship each week?  That sounds doable, yeah. I think I could manage that. I could schedule in some time for meditation and maybe a few hikes each week. How about we set a reminder for that? Maybe you could also create a calming bedtime routine to help signal to your body that it’s time to wind down. That could work. I’ll try to set a reminder on my phone. I think gaining more hands-on experience would help. Maybe volunteering at an aquarium or with a conservation group. That sounds like a great plan! Would you like to research some local organizations that align with your interests? Wonderful! Let’s make that another goal for this week. Research at least two organizations and see how you can get involved. Okay, I can do that."
