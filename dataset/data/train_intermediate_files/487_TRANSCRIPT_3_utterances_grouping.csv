Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,I’d like to talk about how to handle feelings of anxiety when they come up. I think I want to focus on setting boundaries. I often take on too much for others.

History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing well. I took your advice and opened up to my siblings about my feelings. It was nerve-wracking at first, but they were really supportive. It felt good to share. It felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I realized I’m not alone in this. Yes, we’ve been more open with each other. It’s like we understand each other better now. I think it’s mostly when I feel overwhelmed with work or personal responsibilities. Mostly with family and friends. I tend to say yes to everything, even when I don’t have the capacity."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been practicing deep breathing, which helps a bit. How about we try a grounding exercise? It can help you stay present and reduce anxiety. Let’s start by taking a few deep breaths together. Inhale deeply through your nose… and exhale slowly through your mouth.  It’s understandable to feel that way. You can approach it with honesty and compassion. You might say something like, “I really value our time together, but I need to take care of myself too.”"
Next Steps,I think I can do that. Maybe with a friend who always asks for favors.
