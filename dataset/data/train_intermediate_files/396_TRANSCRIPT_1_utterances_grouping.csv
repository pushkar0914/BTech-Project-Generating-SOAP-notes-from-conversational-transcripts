Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve tried some breathing exercises, but it’s tough to quiet my mind.   Breathing exercises can be helpful. Would you like to try a short mindfulness exercise together now?   Okay, let’s take a deep breath in… and out. Focus on the sensation of your breath.  "
Next Steps,"I think I could do that. I’ll try to go hiking at least twice.   How about we set a goal to research some options this week? You could look into local physical therapists or online resources.   That sounds doable. I’ll look into it.   I guess I’ll try to talk to her about it.   Yeah, I’ll work on that.   Great! Let’s plan to discuss how that conversation goes in our next session.  "
