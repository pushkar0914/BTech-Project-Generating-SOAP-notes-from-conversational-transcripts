History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay, a bit stressed with work, but managing it. Yes, I did! I sent him a text, and we ended up having a nice conversation. It’s been hectic. I tried to delegate that task like we talked about, but I still struggled with it. I ended up taking it back because I wasn’t confident it would be done right. I need to work on trusting my team more. I’ve thought about it, but it’s hard to stick to them. I’ve been thinking about my health and fitness lately. I want to make sure I’m taking care of myself. I’ve been exercising regularly, but I sometimes struggle with my diet, especially when I’m busy."

Psychosocial History,"It felt good. We talked about some family memories, and it made me realize how much I miss those connections. I think so. I want to make an effort to stay in touch more regularly. I want to take her out for ice cream or maybe a movie. Just some quality time together."

Current Functional Status,"I usually just say, “Can you handle this for me?” but I realize that’s not very clear. That sounds much better. It gives them a clear understanding of what I expect. I feel more confident about it. I’ll give it a shot and see how it goes. That could work. If they know when I’m unavailable, it might help me stick to it."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Yes, I’d like that. I think I need to set clearer expectations when I delegate. It’s easy to let nutrition slip when life gets hectic. Would you like to explore some meal planning strategies? Great! One approach could be to plan your meals for the week ahead. You could prepare some meals in advance to save time during busy days. How does that sound?"
Next Steps,"Yes, I’ll try to set a specific end time for my workday and stick to it. Yes, that would be helpful. I want to make healthier choices. That sounds doable. I could set aside a few hours on the weekend to prep. Exactly! It can help you stay on track with your nutrition. Would you like to set a goal for meal prepping this week? Yes, I’ll aim to prep at least two meals for the week."
