History of Present Illness (HPI),"I see. Last time, we talked about your living situation and how you feel about having roommates. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke?   Yeah, it still sucks. I just need my own place, you know?   That sounds frustrating. Have you considered any steps towards finding your own space?   Not really. I mean, it’s expensive here. I can barely afford what I have.   That’s understandable. It can be tough in such a high-cost area. What do you think would help you feel more at ease in your current situation?   I guess just more alone time. I wish I could just lock myself in a room sometimes.   That’s a beautiful way to describe it. Do you think music helps improve your mood when you’re feeling down?   Definitely. It’s like an escape.   That’s great to hear. Have you noticed any specific times when music has helped you recently?   Yeah, I was feeling kind of low last week, and I put on some old albums. It helped a lot.   I’m glad to hear that. It sounds like you have a healthy coping mechanism. Have you thought about other activities that could help lift your spirits?   Maybe. I used to like drawing, but I haven’t done that in a while.   Drawing can be a wonderful outlet. What do you think has stopped you from picking it up again?   I don’t know. Just lost interest, I guess.   Great! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. You mentioned feeling down sometimes. Are there specific triggers that you’ve noticed?   Just the usual stuff. Work, living situation, not having friends around.   I’ve tried, but it’s hard to find people I click with.   Maybe. I’m not sure how comfortable I’d feel in a group.  "

Current Functional Status,"That makes sense. Have you found any ways to carve out that alone time?   A little. I just try to be out when they’re around, but it’s not always possible.   Yeah, I’ve been digging into my collection a bit more. It’s relaxing.  "

Next Steps,"That’s understandable. Sometimes interests shift. What if we set a small goal for you to try drawing again this week?   I could try. It might be nice to get back into it.   That sounds like a positive step! How about setting aside just 10-15 minutes a few times this week to doodle or sketch?   Yeah, I can do that.   Those are valid concerns. Have you thought about ways to connect with others, even if it’s just online?   That makes sense. It’s important to find the right fit. Would you be open to exploring new social avenues, like local meetups or hobby groups?   That’s understandable. We can take it slow. How about just researching some options this week?   Yeah, I could do that.  "
