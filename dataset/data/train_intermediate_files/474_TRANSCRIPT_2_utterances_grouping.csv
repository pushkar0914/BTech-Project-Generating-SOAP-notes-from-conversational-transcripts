History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay. I’ve been practicing the breathing exercises before bed.   That’s a great step forward. Have you had any challenges at work since we last met?   Just the usual stress, I guess. But I’m managing it better.   I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything, though.   It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially with new changes. Can you identify what’s contributing to that feeling?   I think it’s the pressure to perform well at work and keep up with everything else.  "
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Wonderful! It sounds like you’re making progress. How have your relationships with your coworkers been?   They’ve been good! I even went out for coffee with a couple of them.   It felt nice to connect with them outside of work.   Absolutely! You’re proving to yourself that you belong there. Have you thought more about your family relationships since our last session?   Yes, I reached out to my mom, and we had a nice chat.   It was good. We talked about some old memories and laughed.   I think so. It made me realize that even if we don’t talk often, we still care.  "

Physiological Observations,"That’s fantastic! How has that impacted your sleep?   It’s helped a lot! I’ve been falling asleep faster.   That’s great to hear! Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels during the day?   Yeah, I feel less scatterbrained and more focused at work.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s a positive sign! Have you been able to apply any coping strategies when stress arises?   I’ve been taking those walks during breaks, and it helps clear my head.   It could be helpful! Sometimes sharing those feelings can lighten the load. Would you like to explore some ways to approach that conversation?   Yeah, I think that would be good.   Let’s brainstorm some ideas. You might start by expressing how you’re feeling and asking for support.   That sounds doable.  "
Next Steps,"That’s a beautiful realization. Would you like to continue reaching out to your family members?   Yes, I think I will.   Great! Setting small goals for communication can help strengthen those bonds. Is there anyone else you’d like to reach out to?   Maybe my brother. We haven’t talked in a while.   That sounds like a good idea. How about setting a goal to text or call him this week?   Yeah, I can do that.   That’s understandable. Have you considered discussing your feelings with someone at work?   I haven’t, but maybe I should.   I’m glad to hear that! Let’s keep working on these goals and check in next time about your progress with your family and work relationships.  "
