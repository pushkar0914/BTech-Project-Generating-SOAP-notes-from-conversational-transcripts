History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been doing okay, still working on the communication with my daughters and my mom. Yes, I talked to them, and it went better than I expected. They seemed receptive and actually opened up about their feelings. I felt relieved and proud that we could talk openly. I tried setting lighter topics, but it was challenging. She kept bringing up past issues, and I felt overwhelmed. Great! It’s all about finding what feels comfortable for you. Have you noticed any changes in your feelings of guilt regarding your mom? I think it’s lessening. I’m starting to accept that I did what I needed to do for my mental health. Yes, we had a fun movie night recently, and it felt nice to bond. It felt great to laugh together. It reminded me of the good times. I’ve been trying to focus less on that. I want to feel good in my own skin."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Empowerment is key! How about we create a few affirmations together that you can use daily? How about, “I am worthy of love and respect just as I am”?  Great! Let’s come up with a couple more together.  “I celebrate my uniqueness” sounds good. “I am strong and capable” feels right."
Next Steps,"I’d like to plan more family activities, maybe a game night or outings. I think it will help me shift my mindset. I think we covered a lot. I feel more equipped to handle my relationships and my own feelings. I’m glad to hear that! Remember, progress takes time, and you’re doing great. For our next session, we can continue to explore these themes and any new challenges that arise."
