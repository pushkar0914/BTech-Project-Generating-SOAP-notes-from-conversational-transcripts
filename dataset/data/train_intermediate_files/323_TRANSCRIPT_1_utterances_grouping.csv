History of Present Illness (HPI),"You mentioned some anxiety about projects and deadlines. Have you had any experiences with that since we last talked? A little. I had a couple of assignments due, and I felt the usual pressure. I stayed up late a couple of nights, but I managed to get everything done. It sounds like you handled it well. What strategies did you use to cope with the anxiety this time? I tried to break the work into smaller tasks and set mini-deadlines for myself. It helped a lot. Yes, I think so. I might try that with my travel plans for the year. I want to visit a few places, but it can be a lot to organize. I think it’s mostly good. I try to keep the peace, but sometimes I feel like I’m not being heard. Yes, actually. There was a disagreement with my bridge partner about strategy. I didn’t want to push my point, but it bothered me."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Oh, definitely the family gatherings. We had a big dinner, and I tried out a new dessert recipe that everyone loved! Yes, it really does. I love cooking and baking for them. I’m thinking about going back to Europe, maybe Italy this time, and I want to visit some national parks in the U.S. I’ve always wanted to see the art and architecture there. Plus, I love Italian food!"
Risk Assessment,"A little anxious but mostly excited! I just need to make sure I plan everything well. I just let it go, but I felt frustrated. I wish I could have spoken up without causing tension."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One technique we could try is using ""I"" statements. For example, instead of saying, ""You always do this,"" you could say, ""I feel frustrated when this happens."" It focuses on your feelings rather than placing blame. Wonderful! Practicing this in low-stakes situations might help you feel more comfortable using it in more significant discussions. "
Next Steps,"Maybe I can make a checklist of things I need to do and set deadlines for each task. Well, I need to decide on the dates and book flights. I think late spring would be nice. The weather should be pleasant then. I’ll need to look at accommodations. I want to stay somewhere that feels local, not just a hotel. I’ve heard good things about Airbnb. I think it would be nice to have a home-like atmosphere. Airbnb can provide a unique experience. Would you like to research some options together for your next session? I’d like to work on the travel planning and practice those communication techniques."
