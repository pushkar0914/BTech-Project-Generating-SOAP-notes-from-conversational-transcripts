History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey! I’ve been doing okay. I actually tried writing down some ideas like we talked about. It felt really freeing. I just wrote whatever came to mind without worrying about it being perfect. Yeah, I came up with a couple of funny sketches. One is about a guy who can’t stop getting stuck in awkward situations. I was thinking of maybe writing a script for it. Just to see how it flows. I’m a little nervous about that. What if they don’t find it funny? I think it’s mostly stress from school and my relationships. Sometimes it just feels like too much."

I feel more relaxed when I do it."
