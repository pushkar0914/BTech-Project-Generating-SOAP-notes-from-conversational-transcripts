History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been feeling a bit better, thank you. I had a family dinner last weekend. I felt more relaxed. I think I was really present this time, and it made a difference. That’s beautiful. Encouraging her like that can strengthen your bond. Speaking of support, how have you been feeling about your past relationships, especially your second marriage, since we last discussed it? I’ve been reflecting on it a lot. I realize now that I was really set in my ways. I think it was partly fear. I was afraid of losing control or being vulnerable. I think I’m starting to see the value in it. Being vulnerable can lead to deeper connections. I think I want to understand why I was so resistant to change back then. I remember a few arguments we had about wanting different things in life. I just wouldn’t budge. I feel hopeful. I want to learn from my past and do better in the future."

Next Steps,Maybe by sharing more of my feelings with my daughters and granddaughters. I think I’d like to share how much I appreciate them and how proud I am of them. I think I could listen more and try to understand her perspective instead of just defending my own. I’d like to explore more about how I can improve my communication with my family.
