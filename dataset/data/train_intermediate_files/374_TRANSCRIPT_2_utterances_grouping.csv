History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! It’s been a mixed bag, honestly. I did some of the things we talked about, but I still feel a bit stuck. I wrote down my strengths and sent out a couple more resumes. But I still feel anxious about the whole job search. I think it’s just the uncertainty of it all. I keep thinking, “What if I don’t hear back?” or “What if I get rejected again?” Yeah, when I think about it too much, I just want to give up. It feels like I’m stuck in this cycle. Not really. I haven’t heard back from any of the places I applied to, which is frustrating. I try to distract myself, but sometimes it just lingers.  I think that could be useful. I used to write a lot, but I haven’t done it in a while."

Physiological Observations,"That sounds perfect! It could be a nice way to unwind. How about your sleep? Have you noticed any changes since we last spoke? I’ve been trying the deep breathing before bed, and it’s helping a bit, but I still wake up sometimes."

Next Steps,"It’s great that you’re trying the breathing exercises. It might take time to see consistent improvements. Have you thought about keeping a sleep journal to track patterns? It could be very insightful! You might discover triggers or patterns that you can address. Would you be willing to give that a shot? Yeah, I can try that. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. Would it help to talk about your feelings of frustration in a more constructive way, perhaps through journaling or art? Writing can be a powerful outlet for processing emotions. Would you consider setting aside some time each week to write about your feelings and experiences? Yes, I think I’ll try that.  Great! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you want to focus on for the upcoming week. You’ll continue job searching, enjoy some movie time, practice deep breathing, keep a sleep journal, and start writing again. How does that sound? That sounds like a solid plan!"
