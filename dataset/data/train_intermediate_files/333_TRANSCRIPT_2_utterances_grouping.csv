History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing pretty well, actually. I took a couple of walks by the beach like we talked about. Yes, definitely! I felt more inspired and motivated to write. I think it was just feeling good about the ideas I had. Plus, I really wanted to keep that momentum going. I try to remind myself that it’s part of the process and that not every idea has to be perfect. I think I’d feel proud of myself for putting my work out there, regardless of the outcome. Just thinking about some friendships. I feel like I haven’t been as connected to my friends lately. I think I’ve been so focused on my writing that I haven’t made time for socializing."

Therapeutic Interventions,One approach is to create a “success journal.” You can write down positive feedback you’ve received or moments when you felt proud of your work. Would you be willing to try that? That sounds helpful. I think I’d like to do that.
Next Steps,"Absolutely! Sometimes taking that risk can lead to growth and new opportunities. Would you be open to setting a goal around submitting your screenplay? Yes, I’d like to aim to submit it by the end of the month. It’s easy to get wrapped up in our passions. How about setting a goal to reconnect with a friend this week? That sounds good! I’ll reach out to a couple of them."
