History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! They’ve been pretty good. I did some research on business programs and even reached out to a couple of people. It felt empowering, like I’m finally taking steps toward my goals. I got some good feedback about the programs too. The people I talked to emphasized the importance of networking and getting involved in clubs. They said it really helps in the business field. I’m considering it. I think it could help me build confidence and meet new people. I’m thinking about joining a marketing or entrepreneurship club. Those seem aligned with my interests. I actually tried using the ""I"" statements during our family gathering, and it went better than I expected! They seemed surprised at first, but they listened. I felt heard, which was a relief. I learned that it’s okay to express myself. I don’t have to avoid conflict all the time; sometimes, it can lead to understanding. I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything I’m trying to juggle, like work, family, and school. I’ve been trying to prioritize my tasks, but I still find myself feeling anxious about everything."

Therapeutic Interventions,Simple practices like deep breathing or guided meditation can be quite helpful. They can create a moment of calm amidst the chaos. Would you like to try a brief breathing exercise together?
Next Steps,I want to keep practicing my communication skills. Maybe I can set aside time each week to reflect on my interactions. I think I could make time for that. It seems beneficial.
