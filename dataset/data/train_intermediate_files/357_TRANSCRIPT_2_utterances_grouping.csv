History of Present Illness (HPI),"I tried the breathing exercises a few times. It helped me feel calmer. I’m glad to hear that! How did you feel before and after practicing? Before, I felt a bit anxious about school. After, I felt more focused and ready to tackle my work. That’s a significant improvement! Have you noticed any changes in your interactions with your girlfriend since practicing active listening? Yeah, I think it helped. We’ve been communicating better.  Sometimes I forget to practice mindfulness when I’m busy. I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with school assignments. I’ll probably be nervous, but also proud."
