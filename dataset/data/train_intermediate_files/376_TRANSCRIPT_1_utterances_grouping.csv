History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I've had a rough few days, to be honest. Just feeling overwhelmed with everything. Well, work has been really stressful lately. I feel like I'm juggling too many responsibilities and it's just wearing me down. Yeah, I have a project that's behind schedule, and my boss is breathing down my neck about it. I feel like I'm constantly being watched. I used to journal a lot when I was younger, but I haven't in years.  You mentioned that your eating habits have changed since your mom passed. How are you feeling about that now? I used to love hiking, but I haven’t gone in a while."

Physiological Observations,"Awesome! How about your sleep? You mentioned having trouble staying asleep. Has that improved at all? Not really. I still wake up a lot, usually thinking about work or my mom. I've tried some breathing exercises, but they don’t always work. "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Great! One option could be to write down your thoughts. Journaling can help you process your feelings without the pressure of immediate feedback. Have you ever tried that? It could be a good way to reconnect with your feelings. Maybe start with just a few minutes each day?  Breathing exercises can be helpful. Would you be open to trying a guided meditation before bed?  Great! I can help you find some resources for that. It might help calm your mind before sleep.  For instance, physical activity can be a great way to relieve stress. Have you considered incorporating more movement into your routine?"
Next Steps,"Hiking could be a wonderful way to reconnect with something you love. Would you be willing to set a small goal to go hiking this week? Fantastic! Setting a specific day and time can help make it happen.  I’ll try to go on Saturday morning. Yeah, I think I’ll try to talk to them tonight. Of course! I’m here for you. So, to recap, we’ll work on journaling, try guided meditation, plan that hike, and talk to your partner. "
