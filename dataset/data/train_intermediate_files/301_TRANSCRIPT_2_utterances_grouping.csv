History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey! I’ve been okay. I actually tried writing a song like we talked about. It was a bit rough, but I enjoyed the process. I didn’t put too much pressure on myself, which helped. I learned that it’s okay to not be perfect. I had fun, and that’s what matters. Yeah, I think I will. I want to keep exploring it, maybe even collaborate with some friends. I feel good about it. I think they’d be supportive. I’ve been trying to do some breathing exercises, and it’s been surprisingly helpful. Definitely. I feel like I’m more aware of my emotions now, and it’s easier to take a step back before reacting. Yeah, there was a moment last week when I felt really stressed at work. Instead of snapping at someone, I took a few deep breaths and calmed down. I think I tend to isolate myself sometimes. I want to be more proactive in reaching out to friends. I guess sometimes I just assume they’re busy or that they won’t want to hang out."
