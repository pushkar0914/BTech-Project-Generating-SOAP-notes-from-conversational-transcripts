History of Present Illness (HPI),um it took about a year before i really felt comfortable but once that got through that kinda hard year it was pretty good out here i've had a good time really hard 'cause there's a lot of people that have the same dream so um <sigh> it was at work couple about a month ago <ag> about a month ago mad at someone because i didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions and so um when i tried to have a conversation about it they got mad and then i got mad and um i felt like i wasn't being heard or listened to and i felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so um because we couldn't have a dialogue i felt like no one was listening to me uh one time i was driving behind someone and they well they cut me off i think it'd just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago or i just it had been a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and i almost got in an accident with them i just followed them to their parking spot actually i had honked at them and they they flipped me off and so it just really really got under my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh so i i followed them to the spot and i asked i said miss why did you flip me off when you cut me off oh i guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom uh telling her i was gay i mean it wasn't hard 'cause it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she she had trouble accepting it and it it took awhile but once she did you know everything was better and i knew it would be my grandfather found our dog run over on the on the road uh like seeing death like that really just uh it was just one of those moments that i i guess i wish i hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad it was just one of those moments i guess you need as a kid but i didn't really wanna experience like loss like that in your face well i've been between jobs recently i start a new job uh next week um well since i've had a lot of time on my hands like i don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because i was uh i was the fat <f> i was the fat kid like this is like out of a movie right like he had put bandaids on my back that said like i'm a fat cow there's like bandaids on your back that say all these mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take 'em off i would try to let myself know to to look at things positively and to not like worry what other people think about you
