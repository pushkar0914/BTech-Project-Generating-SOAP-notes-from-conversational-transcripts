History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! I've been okay, I think. A bit up and down, but overall, I'm doing alright. I've been trying to meditate more regularly, but it’s tough to stick with it. I often forget or get distracted. Yes, actually. Just last week, I lost my temper again while cooking dinner. The kids were all over the place, and I just snapped."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Not really. I’ve been caught up with work and the kids’ schedules. It’s hard to find time. They were understanding, but I could see they were still a bit hurt. I want to be a better example for them."

Mental Health Observations,Nothing reported
Physiological Observations,"I’ve been trying to read less at night, but it’s hard. I still find myself up late."
Current Functional Status,Nothing reported
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,"I isolated myself for a bit, took some deep breaths, and then apologized to the kids. I feel guilty afterward. I feel optimistic. I think having a plan will help me stay on track."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I like that idea! It might help me reflect on my progress and keep me motivated. I think I need to communicate better. Maybe I can tell them when I’m feeling overwhelmed before it gets to that point. That’s a great strategy. You could also practice using “I” statements to express your feelings. For example, “I feel stressed when there’s too much noise while I’m cooking.”  I haven’t, but that’s a good idea. If I set a time to wind down, I might actually stick to it. I could start by turning off screens an hour before bed, maybe do some light stretching or read something calming instead."
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that! Let’s set some specific goals for the next session. How about we check in on your meditation practice, journaling, and sleep routine? Yes, that sounds good. I’ll make sure to keep track of everything."
