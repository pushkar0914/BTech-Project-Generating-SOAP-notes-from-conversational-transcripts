History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I’ve been trying to focus more on the positive things in my life. Yeah, I’ve been spending more time with my cats and watching funny shows. They make me laugh. I went to the beach last weekend. It was nice, but I didn’t have enough money to do much. Just the sound of the waves and the sun. It makes me feel relaxed. It’s still tough. I’m looking for jobs, but it’s hard to find something that pays enough. I’ve been looking online, but I don’t have anyone to help me. It still comes and goes. Some days are better, but sometimes I just feel really down. I think it’s mostly when I think about my financial situation. It really gets to me. Not really. I usually just let it get to me."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Would you be open to trying some coping strategies? For example, when you start to feel overwhelmed, you could take a few deep breaths or write down your feelings. I could try writing. I used to do that a lot."
Next Steps,"Maybe I could go for walks by the beach more often, even if I don’t spend money. That sounds like a great plan! Walking can be a wonderful way to clear your mind. How do you feel about setting a goal to walk by the beach at least once a week? I think I could do that. It would be nice. Would you be open to exploring local job resources or networking opportunities? Sometimes connecting with others can lead to new possibilities. Maybe I could start by joining a group or class. That way, I could meet people. I’ve always wanted to try a painting class or something creative. That sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself! Plus, it might help you meet new people. How would you feel about researching some local classes? I think I could do that. It might be fun. Writing can be a powerful outlet. How about setting a goal to write about your feelings at least once or twice a week? Yeah, I think that would help. I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs. Let’s plan for our next session and see how your goals go. "
