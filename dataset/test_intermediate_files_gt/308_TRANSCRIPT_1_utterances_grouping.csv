History of Present Illness (HPI),"That sounds like a lot to handle. Last time, we talked about your job search and how challenging it’s been. Have there been any updates on that front? Well, I did get a couple of callbacks, but nothing solid yet. It’s just frustrating. I can imagine. It’s tough when you’re putting in so much effort and not seeing the results you want. How did you feel when you received those callbacks? I felt a glimmer of hope, but it faded quickly when nothing came through.  Sometimes it helps, but other times it feels like it’s just too much to handle. I tend to just shut down or isolate myself. It’s easier that way, you know? Excellent! I’d love to hear how it goes in our next session. Now, let’s talk about your feelings of depression. Have you noticed any changes in your mood recently? It’s been a bit of a mixed bag. Some days are better, but I still have those dark moments."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I don't really have anyone I can talk to. My family is not really supportive, and I don’t want to burden anyone else."
Risk Assessment,"Those fluctuations are normal, especially given everything you’re experiencing. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide lately? No, I haven't thought about that in a while. It’s more just feeling hopeless."
Mental Health Observations,Definitely. The movement helps clear my mind. 
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,"Yeah, I went for a long skate the other day. It felt good to be out, even if it was just for a little while."
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,Nothing reported
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to focus on my breath more, especially when I start to feel overwhelmed. I used to write a lot. Journaling helped me sort through my thoughts. Writing can be a powerful tool for processing emotions. Would you be willing to try journaling again?"
Next Steps,"That’s understandable. It can be tough to feel like you’re burdening others. However, having someone to share your feelings with can be beneficial. Would you be open to exploring support groups or community resources? I guess I could look into that. I just don’t know where to start. That’s okay. We can brainstorm together. There are often local resources for job seekers and mental health support. Would you like to explore some options? Yeah, that sounds helpful.  Perhaps you could set a small goal, like writing for just five minutes a day? It doesn’t have to be perfect; just let your thoughts flow. That sounds doable. I can try that. I’m glad to hear that. Hopelessness can feel heavy, though. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. Would you like to discuss some ways to cope with that hopelessness? Yeah, I think that would help. One approach could be to focus on small, achievable goals. What’s one small thing you could do this week that would give you a sense of accomplishment? Maybe I could apply for a couple of jobs, even if they’re not ideal."
