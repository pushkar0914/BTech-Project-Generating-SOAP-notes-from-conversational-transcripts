History of Present Illness (HPI),um initially it was easy because i felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally i guess just my childhood in general growing up um i consider myself more shy watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago there's been like some tension going on since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will tick me off that are really nasty and so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made my grandmother's funeral which i don't know i kind of just feel very like so so no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of one note land like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went so it kind of create created more problems for me really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just i am very shy and um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that
Medical and Psychiatric History,no no i have been diagnosed with anxiety no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it
Psychosocial History,i'm from greenwich connecticut um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there it's less superficial <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california uh fine arts and photography um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments so i decided to pursue art um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting um well my family's very close my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries um she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing people who aren't my good friends would describe me i'm very caring i'm a very good judge of character i'm very affectionate <aff>

Physiological Observations,um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m i will be up like clockwork by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday
