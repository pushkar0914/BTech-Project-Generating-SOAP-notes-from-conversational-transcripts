History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been a mix. I talked to my wife like we discussed, and it went really well. I told her how I’ve been feeling about my health journey and how I sometimes feel stressed. She was really understanding. It felt good to share. I think it brought us closer. That’s a significant step forward! Have you noticed any changes in how you approach stress since then? Yeah, I feel like I can talk to her more openly now. It’s less of a burden, I guess. Well, I did have a few stressful days at work, and I found myself slipping back into some old habits. I skipped my workouts a couple of times and grabbed takeout instead of cooking. I think it was just being overwhelmed with deadlines. I didn’t want to think about cooking. I felt guilty, like I was letting myself down. Maybe I can see it as a learning experience instead of a failure? Yes! We went to the park together, and it was really nice to see them play and have fun. I feel happy and more connected to them."

Next Steps,I could plan easier meals for those busy days or even involve my kids in cooking. I think I want to focus on being kinder to myself when I slip up.
