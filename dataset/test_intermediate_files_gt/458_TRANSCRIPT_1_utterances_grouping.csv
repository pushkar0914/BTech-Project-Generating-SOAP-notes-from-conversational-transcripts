History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been okay, I guess. I’ve been thinking a lot about what we discussed, especially about my temper. That’s great to hear you’re reflecting on it. Have you noticed any specific situations where your temper has come up this week? Yeah, actually. I had a little argument with my ex over the weekend. It was about the kids and how we manage things. I felt myself getting really frustrated. I tried to take a deep breath and remind myself to stay calm, but I still ended up raising my voice a bit.  It sounds like you’re making an effort to control your reactions, which is a positive step. What do you think triggered your frustration? I think it was just feeling overwhelmed. He wasn’t understanding my point of view, and it felt like we were going in circles. I’ve been studying for the exam, and I feel like I’m making progress. It’s a lot of information, though."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That can be really challenging. Would it help to explore some coping strategies for when you feel overwhelmed in those conversations? Yes, definitely. I want to learn how to keep my cool. One technique we could try is grounding exercises. They can help you stay present and manage your emotions. Would you like to practice one together now? Sure, I’d like that. Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on your breathing. Inhale deeply through your nose... and exhale slowly through your mouth. How does that feel? It feels calming.  Excellent. You can use that technique whenever you feel your temper rising. What do you think about practicing this before your conversations with your ex? I think that would be helpful. I’ll definitely try it. It’s normal to face distractions. Would it help to create a structured study plan or schedule to keep you focused? Yes, I think that could help. I need to be more organized. I can do five days a week, I think. Perfect! Now, let’s break it down. How about you focus on a specific topic each day?  That sounds good. I can start with the basics of real estate law. Excellent choice. As you progress, we can discuss what you’ve learned and any challenges you face.  That would be great! "
Next Steps,"As we wrap up today, let’s set a goal for the next session. How about you practice the breathing technique and stick to your study schedule?  I can do that."
