History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! It was a mixed bag. I managed to take a photo every day, but I didn’t reach out to my roommates yet.   I loved getting creative again! It felt good to focus on something I love.   Definitely! I felt more motivated and less stressed.   I guess I was just nervous about how it would go.   Maybe just reminding myself it’s okay to be vulnerable and reach out.   I applied to a couple of photography gigs, but still no responses.   A bit nerve-wracking, but also exciting. I felt like I was taking steps in the right direction.   We had a good talk about our feelings, and I think we’re in a better place right now.   Yeah, it felt good to be honest with each other.   I do! It’s nice to feel like we’re on the same team again.   I think I’m feeling more positive! The photography and reconnecting with my boyfriend really helped.   It really is. I’m starting to feel more like myself again.  "

Next Steps,"Yes, I think I’ll text them after our session.   I’ll suggest a movie night this weekend.   I haven’t yet, but that’s a good idea.   Networking can open doors. Maybe you could attend a photography workshop or join a local group?   I’ll look into that!   Not yet, but that’s a great idea! Maybe we’ll go hiking or something.   For sure! I’ll suggest it.   So, for our next session, you’ll reach out to your roommates, look into networking opportunities, and plan a date with your boyfriend. Sound good?  "
