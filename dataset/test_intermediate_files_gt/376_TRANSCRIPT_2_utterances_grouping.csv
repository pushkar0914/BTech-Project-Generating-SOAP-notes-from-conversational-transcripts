History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I actually went hiking on Saturday, and it was really nice to be outdoors. It felt great! I forgot how much I love being in nature. It was refreshing. Yeah, I felt a lot lighter and more relaxed.  I did! It was a little awkward at first, but they were really supportive. Yeah, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. I still have my moments, but I think being honest with them has helped a lot. I feel a bit lighter, like I’m not holding everything in. I’ve been thinking about my mom a lot lately. Some days are harder than others. I just let myself feel it, but I try to distract myself with other things too."

Physiological Observations,"I did, and it actually helped me fall asleep faster.  I’m still waking up sometimes, but it’s not as bad as before. "
Current Functional Status,"I started journaling again, but I haven’t tried meditation yet. Mostly my feelings about work and my mom. It helps to get it out on paper. I’m trying to be more mindful about what I eat. I still struggle, but I’m working on it. I’ve been trying to listen to my body more. I think I’m getting better at it. "
