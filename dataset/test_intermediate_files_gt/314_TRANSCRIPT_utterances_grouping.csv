Psychosocial History,los angeles california here um native born los angelinos i'm a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the  most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody just because i enjoy learning about other people are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband he's been a really um it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so um i'm considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and um we love each other very much it's a good relationship we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throws of that and um so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish a group with her that was a six month um group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a  it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental um strategies to keep your uh keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter really informational and really helpful i think oh my daughter was um she was in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and we knew it and um we acted on it that's all probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan  uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful we left on our anniversary day flew to israel uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in the birth the bringing of new life into this world so was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed i like i said i do it for family members i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]  two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter] yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do uh probably my my own birth i mean my the birth of my own children it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome and i have experienced both ways i've done both um my last child was via c_section so i've had both psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've we're an in tact family that my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and
