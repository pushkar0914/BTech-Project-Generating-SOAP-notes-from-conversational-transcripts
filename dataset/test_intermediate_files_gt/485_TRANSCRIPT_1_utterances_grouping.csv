History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, I've been okay, I guess. Just trying to settle in more. That's good to hear. Last time, we talked about your move to L.A. and how you were feeling a bit more depressed being away from friends and family. Have you noticed any changes in those feelings? Yeah, I think it’s gotten a little better. I’ve been trying to connect with some people here, but it’s still tough. Not really. I’m still a bit shy about opening up. I don’t want to scare them off. I guess I worry they won’t understand or that they’ll think I’m being dramatic. Well, I’ve been thinking about my family a lot lately. I miss them."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Well, I joined a few online gaming communities. It feels a bit like home talking to people who share the same interests. A couple of people, yeah. We've been chatting a bit outside of the games, so that’s nice. Mostly just catching up on life. I tell them about my job hunt and they share what’s going on back home."
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,"It feels good. It's nice to talk to someone who gets my interests. Makes me feel less alone. It felt really good. I was nervous at first, but once I got talking about games, it was like I found my groove. A bit anxious, but I think I can do it. "
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,"Actually, I went to a local gaming café last week. It was fun to be around people who love games too. I try to call them when I can. It helps, but it’s not the same as being there."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One approach could be to start small—sharing lighter feelings or experiences before diving into deeper topics. How does that sound? Yeah, I could try that. Maybe just talking about how I’m adjusting to L.A. would be a good start. I guess I could try going to more events like that. Maybe even invite some of the people I’ve met online to join me. That’s completely normal. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious. You can also practice what you might say if that helps ease your nerves. Good idea. I’ll write it down. "
Next Steps,"That’s a brilliant idea! It could help strengthen those connections. Would you like to set a goal for the next week to try that? Yeah, I think I’ll look up some events. Maybe even a game night. It sounds like those conversations are meaningful for you. Have you considered scheduling regular calls, like a weekly check-in? Yeah, I think I’ll do that. It would give me something to look forward to. I’m glad to hear that! Remember, progress takes time, and you’re doing great. Let’s meet again next week to check in on how things are going."
