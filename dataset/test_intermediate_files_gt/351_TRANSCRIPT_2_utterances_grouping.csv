Therapeutic Interventions,I used the evidence approach we talked about. I’d remind myself of the positive feedback I’ve received. I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself that everyone feels nervous sometimes. I tried to focus on enjoying the conversations.
Next Steps,Maybe I could practice some conversation starters or ways to engage with people more confidently. I think I just want to keep building on this confidence and maybe explore some more coping strategies for when I feel overwhelmed. Absolutely! We can delve deeper into coping strategies in our next session. It’s essential to have a toolkit ready for those moments.
