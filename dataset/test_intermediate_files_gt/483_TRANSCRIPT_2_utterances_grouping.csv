History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie! I’ve been okay. I tried that wind-down routine you suggested.   Yeah, I felt a bit less anxious in the mornings. I think it helped to not be on my phone right before bed.   Well, there are days when I forget to do them, and I feel guilty about it.   I think it’s improved a bit. I’ve been trying to take a step back when I feel angry.   I think when I feel overwhelmed with tasks, that’s when I’m more likely to get angry.   It’s been helping a bit. I still struggle with procrastination, though.   I think it’s a mix of fear of failure and just feeling overwhelmed.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been practicing deep breathing and counting to ten before reacting.   I’ve been trying to prioritize tasks and break them down into smaller steps.   One technique is to reframe your perspective on failure. Instead of seeing it as a negative, think of it as an opportunity for growth.   Another approach is to set realistic expectations. Remember, it’s okay to make mistakes. They’re part of the learning process.  "
Next Steps,Absolutely! Let’s set a goal for you to practice this reframing technique over the next week. How does that sound?   Sounds good! I’ll work on it.
