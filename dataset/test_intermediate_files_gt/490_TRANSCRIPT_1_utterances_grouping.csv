History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, I guess. Trying to keep up with the changes I mentioned. I think when I’m tired or stressed, I tend to fall back into old habits. Like, I’ll skip exercising or grab something unhealthy to eat. I’ve tried to plan my meals ahead of time, but it doesn’t always work out. A few, especially when work gets busy. I just have to remind myself to breathe."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"A little. I think she appreciates that I’m trying to be healthier, but sometimes I feel like I don’t want to burden her with my stress. Not really. I guess I’m just worried about adding to her stress."

Next Steps,I think I’ll try to talk to her more openly. And keep up with the meal planning and exercise. How about aiming to share one thing about your feelings with your wife this week? It doesn’t have to be anything huge—just something that’s on your mind.
