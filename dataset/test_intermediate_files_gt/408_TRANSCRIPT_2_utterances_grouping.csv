History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! It was good. I actually had that conversation with my manager, and it went better than I expected! I explained how I was feeling overwhelmed, and they were really understanding. We talked about adjusting some deadlines and prioritizing my tasks. I felt relieved and supported. It was nice to know they care about my well-being. That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you took a significant step in managing your anxiety. Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels since then? Yes, I feel less stressed overall. I’ve been able to focus better on my work. I’d like to discuss my social life a bit. I’ve been feeling a little isolated lately. I think it’s just been busy with work, and I haven’t made time to see friends. I miss hanging out with them. I think they’d be happy to hear from me. They’re usually understanding."
