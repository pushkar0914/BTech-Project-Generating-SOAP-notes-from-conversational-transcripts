History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear! Last time, you mentioned feeling relaxed and invigorated after your day at the beach. Have you had a chance to spend more time outdoors since then?   Yes, actually! I went hiking last weekend. It felt amazing to be in nature again.   It was refreshing. I felt more connected and grounded.   I think it’ll help me feel less stressed and more energized. Just being outside really lifts my mood.   I feel calmer and more focused. It’s easier to handle stress when I meditate regularly.   Well, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work lately.   It’s just a lot of clients and projects piling up, and I’m worried I won’t be able to keep up.   I sometimes struggle with that. I don’t want to seem like I can’t handle things.   I guess it would relieve some stress, but I still feel hesitant.   Just thinking about how to balance work and personal life better.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Yes, I’ve been consistent with that. It really helps me center myself.   It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. Perhaps we can work on building your confidence in asking for help. Would you like to explore that?  "
Next Steps,"I have! I’m trying to set aside time every week for something outdoors.   I’ve thought about prioritizing tasks and maybe delegating some responsibilities.   Yeah, I think that would be helpful.   Maybe I could ask a colleague to help with some client follow-ups.   I think I could do it. It would be a relief to share some of the workload.   That’s a positive mindset! Let’s set that as a goal for this week. How about we check in on how that goes next time?   That’s an important topic. Maybe we can explore some time management strategies next session.   Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress with asking for help and any insights you have about work-life balance.  "
