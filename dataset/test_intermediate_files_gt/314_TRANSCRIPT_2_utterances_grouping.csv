History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yes! I scheduled some time for myself last week and read a book. It felt great!   It was refreshing. I forgot how much I enjoy reading.   I have! I’m trying to make it a regular thing.   I’ve been using deep breathing exercises more often. They help, especially when I feel overwhelmed.   I think I’m handling it better. I still have moments, but I feel more equipped now.   Probably the combination of self-care and being more aware of my triggers.   I feel like we’ve been so busy with everything that we haven’t had much time for each other.   We’ve talked about going on a date night, but it’s hard to find the time.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Grounding exercises help bring your focus back to the present moment. It can involve physical sensations, like feeling your feet on the ground or holding a textured object.   You can start by finding a comfortable position, taking a few deep breaths, and then focusing on your surroundings. What do you see, hear, and feel?   Great! You can practice this whenever you feel anxious. It helps to anchor you in the present.  "
