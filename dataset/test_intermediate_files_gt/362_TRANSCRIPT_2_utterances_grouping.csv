Therapeutic Interventions,"I tried to step outside for a few minutes to breathe and collect my thoughts. It helped a lot. I could talk to them before the next gathering and explain that I might need to step away for a bit. Okay. ""Hey everyone, I just wanted to let you know that I love spending time with you all, but sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed in large groups."" I could say, ""I might need to take a short break during the gathering to recharge, and I hope you understand."""
