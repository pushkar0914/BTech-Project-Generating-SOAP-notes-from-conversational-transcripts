History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve had some ups and downs, but overall, I think I’m doing better.   Well, I did reach out to my aunt like we talked about, and it felt really good to talk to her.   Yes, definitely. I’ve been trying to practice that more.   It’s a work in progress. Some days I’m better at it than others.   It feels good to take steps toward my goal. I’m a little nervous, though.   I think I’m starting to feel a bit more hopeful, but I still have moments of doubt.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been journaling and writing down my worries before bed, and it has helped a bit.   One thing you could try is limiting screen time before bed, as it can interfere with sleep quality.   It might help to remind yourself that rejection is part of the process and doesn’t define your worth or abilities.   Definitely! We can work on that. I’ll prepare some techniques for you to try.  "
Next Steps,"Yes, I think applying to three positions would be a good start.   Maybe we could explore more coping strategies for anxiety?  "
