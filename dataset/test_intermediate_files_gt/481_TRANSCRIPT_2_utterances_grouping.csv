History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been really helpful. Writing down my thoughts has cleared my head a lot. I didn’t realize how much I was holding in. Yeah, I keep writing about my fears regarding my music and my future. It’s like I can’t escape those thoughts. A little bit. I wrote about how I’ve faced challenges before and come out okay. It made me feel stronger. It makes me realize that I’ve overcome obstacles before, so I can handle this too. I just need to keep reminding myself. It’s about my journey and the struggles I’ve faced. I think it’s a way to process everything. It feels liberating. I’m finally putting my emotions into something tangible. I guess I’m still struggling with sleep. It hasn’t improved much. I’ve been trying to meditate before bed, but my mind still races."

Progress Evaluation,"Hey, Ellie! I’ve been doing better, actually. I started journaling like we talked about. I started working on a new song. I’m feeling more inspired lately, which is nice. No, I think we covered everything. I feel good about the journaling and the music."

Therapeutic Interventions,"You could start with something simple, like “I am capable of achieving my dreams.” You can write it down or say it out loud to yourself. One technique is progressive muscle relaxation. It involves tensing and then relaxing each muscle group. Would you like to try it now? Perfect! You can do this with each muscle group, working your way up to your head. It can help signal to your body that it’s time to unwind."
