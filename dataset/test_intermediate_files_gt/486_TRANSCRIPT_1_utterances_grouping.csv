History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, just busy with my friend’s recovery. It’s been challenging, but I’m managing. I try to stay positive for both of us. That's a great approach. Have you noticed any changes in your feelings or thoughts during this time? I think I’ve felt a bit more anxious, especially when things get hectic. I understand. Anxiety can be a natural response in stressful situations. What do you think triggers that anxiety for you? Mostly when I feel overwhelmed with responsibilities or when I see my friend struggling. That makes sense. Have you been able to use any coping strategies to manage that anxiety? I feel responsible, but sometimes it feels like too much.  I haven’t yet. I don’t want to burden him with my worries. I feel like I’m doing my best, but I sometimes doubt if it’s enough. Not really. I often put his needs first."

Therapeutic Interventions,I’ve been listening to jazz more often; it helps calm me down. That’s great to hear! Mindfulness can help ground you in the present moment. Would you like to explore some techniques together? One simple technique is focusing on your breath. Let’s try it: take a deep breath in… and out. How does that feel? Good! You can do this whenever you start to feel anxious. It’s a great way to center yourself.  It’s important to share your feelings. It can help lighten the load. Would you consider talking to him about it?
Next Steps,"That’s a positive outcome. Perhaps we can set a goal for you to incorporate drawing regularly into your routine? Excellent! Let’s aim for at least a few times a week. How does that sound? Maybe setting specific times for myself, like drawing or relaxing. That sounds like a healthy idea. It’s okay to prioritize your self-care. Would you like to create a schedule together? Let’s outline some time for self-care and stick to it. How about we check in on how that goes in our next session?"
