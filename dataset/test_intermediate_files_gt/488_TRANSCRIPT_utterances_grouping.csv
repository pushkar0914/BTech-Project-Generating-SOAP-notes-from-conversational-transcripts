Medical and Psychiatric History,no no
Psychosocial History,oh san fernando valley uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system uh not really i like to go camping but i don't really travel um i think <sigh> it might've been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night philosophy yes i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy i don't know but i really like children and i really like studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i i think i'm pretty friendly i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party and he was getting frustrated which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him when i was nineteen i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could again my little sister and i get along really well she's when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch really like serious films and t_v and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so um so that's a major one that and procrastinating um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think i was a little selfish and self-involved back then i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping and maybe watching a little bit of t_v well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and um and how close we are

Current Functional Status,um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about other things if i start getting mad or um i just start trying to focus on my breathing i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic
