Psychosocial History,crime when you go through some sections i'm more shy but i'm forced to be outgoing because i you know you can't really get anything done being shy so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think even though it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot xxx you know have a great time you know i think it's because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough distant siblings you know i don't see as often as i can uh just you know when you when you travel quite a bit you just don't see people 'cause <laughter> they're not always there you know uh i went to a great party last week and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information and a lot of good connections were made i'd kinda like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work um people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but um yeah i'm i've kinda figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me sometime people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that when i <clears throat> when i see too much of that i just uh pull back my my my kinda spiritual relationship you know and my my my settleness about not being too too anxious about about <bout> things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen
