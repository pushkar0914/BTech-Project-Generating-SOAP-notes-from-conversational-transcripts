History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. Last time, we talked a bit about your work ethic and how you feel about completing projects. Have you had any thoughts on that since we last spoke? Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it. I actually started working on a song that I’ve been putting off for a while. I think I just got tired of waiting for the perfect moment or space. I realized I can create something even if it’s not in a perfect studio. It’s been fun! I’m just letting myself play around with ideas without worrying too much about the final product. Honestly, it feels liberating. I’m not stressing over every little detail. Good! I’d like to explore that further. Do you notice any changes in your mood or motivation since you started this new approach? I think I’m feeling a bit more motivated. I’ve been playing more often and not just when I feel like I need to produce something. Yeah, sometimes I feel like I’m not good enough, especially when I compare myself to others. I try to remind myself that everyone has their own journey and struggles, but it’s hard not to compare. I think I start to feel like I have to do everything perfectly, and that just shuts me down. Not really. I just end up avoiding things instead. It feels nice. I can see how that could help when I’m feeling overwhelmed."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One technique is to practice gratitude for your own unique skills and experiences. Would you be open to keeping a gratitude journal focused on your music? That sounds interesting. I could definitely try that. Maybe I could start with the moments I feel proud of what I’ve created, even if it’s not perfect. Would you be interested in exploring some mindfulness techniques to help you stay grounded in those moments? Yeah, I’d like that. We can start with simple breathing exercises. Would you like to practice one now before we finish? Sure, I’d love to try."
Next Steps,"That’s a lovely idea. Focusing on your accomplishments, no matter how small, can help reinforce your self-worth. How do you feel about setting a goal to write in your journal a few times a week? I think I can manage that!  Awesome! How about we check in on that during our next session?  Sounds good to me! Absolutely! Remember, it’s about finding what works for you. Let’s build on this in our next session.  Okay, I’m looking forward to it!"
