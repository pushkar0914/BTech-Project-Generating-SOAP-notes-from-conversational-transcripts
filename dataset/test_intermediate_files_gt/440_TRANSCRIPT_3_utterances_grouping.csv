History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been writing more about my boundaries and how to maintain them. Yes, I feel more centered. I’m not letting their issues take over my emotions as much. It feels freeing, but I still struggle with guilt sometimes. I’ve been more patient with my kids, and I feel more in control of my emotions. I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about my son’s situation again. I’m worried about his future and how this experience will affect him. I feel optimistic and more equipped to handle everything."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I’ve been doing well, actually! I’ve been focusing on my jewelry and keeping up with my journaling. We talked about our stressors and how we can support each other better. It felt good to be open and honest. I think it brought us closer. I think it’ll help us reconnect and relieve some of the tension."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I remind myself of the affirmations we talked about, and I try to focus on the positives. I’ve been trying to focus on what I can control and letting go of what I can’t. I think I could write it down as a mantra and keep it somewhere visible."
Next Steps,I think we can keep having these regular check-ins and maybe even do something fun together. Maybe a date night or even just cooking together.
