History of Present Illness (HPI),"Uh, I’ve been okay, I guess. Some ups and downs, you know. Well, I had a couple of good days where I felt a bit more motivated, but then I’d hit a low and feel like I’m back to square one. Yeah, definitely. It often happens when I’m alone, or when I’m not busy. I guess I need to keep myself occupied. I think it’s mostly motivation. It feels like such a chore sometimes, and I just don’t want to do anything. Maybe. I feel like I’m trying to solve my own mystery sometimes, like why I feel this way. I think it’s figuring out why I can’t seem to shake this feeling of being lost. I used to have direction, and now it’s just... gone."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Just some fiction. It helps me escape for a bit, which is nice. I like mysteries. I guess I enjoy trying to solve the puzzle before the characters do. It feels good. It gives me something to focus on. Just that I appreciate you listening. It feels good to talk about these things."

Physiological Observations,"I’ve been sleeping okay, actually. Better than before, I think. I’m still tired a lot, but at least I’m falling asleep faster. I’ve been trying to read before bed instead of scrolling through my phone. I think it helps me relax."

Next Steps,"Maybe. Like, just doing a few minutes instead of a full session? Yeah, I think I could manage a few minutes. It might help me get back into it. Great! Let’s try that for the week. How about we check in on your progress during our next session? Sure, I can do that. I’ve thought about maybe volunteering or getting involved in some community activities. It might help me feel more connected. I’ve always enjoyed working with kids, so maybe something related to that. Yeah, I think I’d like that. Just need to look into it more."
