History of Present Illness (HPI),"They told me they appreciate my help and support, but they also mentioned a few areas where I could do more.   I felt relieved, honestly. I was worried they’d be more critical.   Yeah, it feels more open now. We’re talking about things we used to avoid.   It makes me feel more connected to them.   I’ve been feeling a bit down lately.   I think it’s a mix of stress from work and just feeling a bit lost about my art.   Not as much as I’d like. I feel like I’m in a creative rut.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"One approach is to use “I” statements. For example, “I feel anxious when we don’t talk about our feelings.” Would you like to practice?   Sure! Um, I feel anxious when we don’t talk about our feelings.   Yeah, I could say I just want to create a safe space for us to talk.   One idea is to set small, achievable goals for your art. For example, you could try painting for just ten minutes a day.   Another approach is to explore new mediums or styles. Have you ever tried mixed media?   It can be a great way to break out of a rut. You could combine painting with collage or photography.  "
Next Steps,Fantastic! How about setting a goal to try a mixed media piece by our next session?   I’ll definitely do that!
