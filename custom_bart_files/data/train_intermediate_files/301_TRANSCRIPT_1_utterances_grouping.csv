History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's good to hear. Last time, we talked about your job situation and how you feel about it. Have there been any updates or changes since then? Not really, still working as an administrative assistant. Just trying to keep my head above water. I understand. Have you had any opportunities to explore other job options or creative ventures? A few, but nothing concrete. I’ve been thinking about starting a small side project, maybe something creative, but I’m not sure yet. I’m not entirely sure. Maybe something with music or art, since I have friends in those areas. Just something to express myself, you know? I guess it’s just the usual fear of failure. What if it doesn’t go anywhere? I suppose it would feel like a waste of time, and I don’t want to disappoint myself or my friends. Yeah, I mean, I tried out for a band once, and even though I didn’t get in, it was fun and I met some cool people. Great! I’m excited to hear how that goes. Now, let’s talk a bit about your temper. You mentioned you’ve been working on controlling it. How has that been going for you? Honestly, it’s been a mixed bag. Some days I feel like I’m doing well, and other days, I just lose it. Yeah, just the other day, I was driving and someone cut me off. I was so angry I almost yelled at them. I think it’s just the stress of everyday life. Sometimes it feels like everything is just piling up."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to exercise more, like running or going to the gym, but I think I need to incorporate some mindfulness too. Mindfulness can be very helpful! Would you be open to trying some mindfulness exercises this week? Sure, I can give it a shot. Maybe some breathing exercises or meditation."
Next Steps,"Maybe I could set smaller goals for myself, like just creating something without worrying about how it will be received. That sounds like a fantastic plan. Smaller goals can help reduce the pressure and make it more enjoyable. What’s a small goal you could set for yourself this week? I could try to write a song or create a piece of art. Just something to get the ball rolling. That sounds like a great plan! Let’s set a goal for you to practice mindfulness a few times this week. How does that sound? I can do that. It might help with the stress and my temper."
