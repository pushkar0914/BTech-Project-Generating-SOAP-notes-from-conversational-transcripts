History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been doing well, actually. I started using the schedule we talked about! It was really helpful. I felt more organized, and I managed to find time for self-care, which made a big difference. I’ve been meditating regularly, and I even finished a book I started a while ago. It felt good to have that time for myself. I felt more relaxed and less anxious. I think it helped me handle my responsibilities better. A few times, things got a bit hectic, and I had to adjust my plans, but I tried to stay flexible as we discussed. I was initially frustrated, but then I reminded myself that it’s okay to change things up. It helped me not to stress too much. Yes, actually! I think I’ve been more calm and focused, which has helped our conversations."

Next Steps,I think we could benefit from having regular date nights to maintain our connection. Maybe once every two weeks to start? I’m excited! We could try a new restaurant or even have a movie night at home. I want to maintain a good GPA and really absorb the material. I also want to network with my classmates. Maybe treating myself to a nice dinner or a day out after completing a big assignment. I think that could help keep me accountable. I’ll definitely consider it.
