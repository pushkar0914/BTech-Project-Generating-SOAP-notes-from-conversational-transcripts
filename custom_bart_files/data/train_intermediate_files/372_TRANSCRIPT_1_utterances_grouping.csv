Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"Not really. Just the same tension with my family. They keep pushing their views on me, and I feel overwhelmed. I try to remind myself that I know what's best for my son, but it's hard when everyone else is so vocal about their opinions. Honestly, I've had some ups and downs. Some days I feel okay, but others I just feel really down like I can't get out of bed. I think it’s mostly when I think about my son. The missing him just hits me hard sometimes. I’ve tried to distract myself by watching shows or reading, but sometimes it just doesn’t work."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to journal more about my feelings, but sometimes I just end up crying instead. Mostly about my worries, like how I’m going to prove I’m a good mom. I write about my hopes for my son too. Yeah, I tend to focus on the negative things, like my fears about losing him. I don’t write enough about the positive moments. Maybe I could start each entry with something good that happened that day, no matter how small. Mindfulness can be very beneficial. Would you like to explore a simple grounding technique together?"
Next Steps,I’d like to try to write more positively in my journal and practice the grounding exercise when I feel anxious.
