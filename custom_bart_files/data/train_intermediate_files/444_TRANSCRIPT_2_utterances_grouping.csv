History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! I’ve been okay, a bit better actually. I’ve been trying to stick to my meditation routine. I’ve managed to meditate most mornings, even if it’s just for a few minutes. I feel calmer throughout the day. Yes, I’ve written a few entries. It helps me reflect on my feelings, but I still find it hard to be consistent. Sometimes the kids’ schedules can throw me off. If they have late activities, it’s hard to stick to my bedtime. Yes! I used it when I felt overwhelmed while making dinner. I told them I needed some quiet time, and it worked! They were really understanding and gave me some space. It felt good to express myself without snapping. I feel more in control. I’m still a work in progress, but I’m getting there."

Next Steps,"That would be great. I think I need to tie it to another habit, like after meditation. That’s a good idea! Pairing it with another established habit can create a routine. How about setting a goal for the next week to journal right after meditating? I’ll definitely try that.  Maybe I can set a slightly earlier bedtime on those days, so I still get enough rest."
