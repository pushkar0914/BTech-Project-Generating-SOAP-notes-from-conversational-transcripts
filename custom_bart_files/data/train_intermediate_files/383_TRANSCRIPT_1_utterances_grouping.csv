History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s great to hear. Last time, you mentioned feeling stable and comfortable. Have there been any changes in that feeling? Not really, but I’ve been trying to explore what that grey really means for me. Like, is it just comfort, or is there something deeper? I think it might lead me to understanding if I’m avoiding something or if I’m genuinely content. Sometimes I worry I’m just coasting through life. I guess it’s about making an impact, you know? With my art, my therapy practice… I want to help people feel better. It’s been eye-opening. Some people are really struggling, and it makes me appreciate my own stability more.  I’m still working on it. I sometimes feel guilty for not doing more, but I know I can’t pour from an empty cup. It feels freeing, honestly. Like, I don’t have to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders."

Current Functional Status,"Well, I’ve started volunteering at a local community center. It feels good to connect with people and share my art.
