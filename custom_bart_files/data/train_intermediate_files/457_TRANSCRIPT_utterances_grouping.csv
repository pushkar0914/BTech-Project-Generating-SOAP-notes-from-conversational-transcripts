History of Present Illness (HPI),after i split up with my ex it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and started having fun mm and then that's uh yeah the rest is ancient history

Mental Health Observations,i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles it was easy to be social it it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing bombastic for the first time and it stuck if i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do an art project uh what temper <laughter> <laughter> panicked 'cause i really wanted to make him not hate me and i mostly failed a couple of scrapes on my ego when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of not my most graceful moment i feel guilty about lots of stuff um i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else 'cause i really love junk food it's really good i have very little food willpower 'cause i used to be a fat guy uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire uh i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor eh it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this uh my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and i'm feeling more and more inspired all the time if i could just work on the motivation i'd be set <sigh> working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling uh helped and put on that's that was really nice it's a nice feeling enthusiastic highly analytical <laughter> oh all sorts of stuff but i'm working on that
Physiological Observations,the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleepland i'm pretty much there until an earthquake uh hits i i get to sleep poorly but then i'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter <deep breath> less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life
