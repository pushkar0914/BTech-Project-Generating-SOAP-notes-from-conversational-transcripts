History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’m glad to hear you're holding up. Last time, we talked about some of the challenges you face with anger and trust issues. Have you had any situations come up where you felt those emotions? Yes, actually. I had an argument with a neighbor. They were playing loud music late at night, and I just lost it. I yelled at them, told them to turn it down. I felt so angry, like they were disrespecting my space. Pretty guilty, honestly. I know I shouldn’t react that way, but it’s like I can’t help it sometimes. Well, there was a time at the store when someone bumped into me and didn’t even apologize. I felt so angry. I thought, “How rude! Why can’t people just be polite?” I felt like I wanted to say something, but I didn’t."

Therapeutic Interventions,"It’s understandable to feel that way. Recognizing those feelings is an important step. Have you had a chance to use any of the coping strategies we discussed last time? I tried to breathe deeply and count to ten before responding, but in the heat of the moment, I just forgot. Maybe I could just say something calmly? Like, “Excuse me, that wasn’t very nice.”"
Next Steps,Maybe I could set reminders on my phone to practice these responses when I’m home.
