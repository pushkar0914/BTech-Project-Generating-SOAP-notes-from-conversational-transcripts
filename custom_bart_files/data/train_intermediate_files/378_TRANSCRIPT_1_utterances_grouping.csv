History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s understandable. Last time, you mentioned feeling worried about money. How has that been for you?   Still worrying, to be honest. I’ve been trying to budget better, but it’s tough.   Yeah, I think I could eat out less. I tend to do that a lot when I’m stressed.   I feel kind of stuck, like I’m in a rut.   I just feel like I’m not moving forward in my career or personal life.   I want to work more with athletes, but I don’t know how to get those opportunities.   I’ve been thinking about reaching out to local sports teams or clinics, but I’m nervous.   I guess I worry about rejection or feeling like I don’t belong.  "

Next Steps,That makes sense. I could do that on Sundays.   Perfect! Let’s set that as a goal for the week. How does that sound?   Sounds good! I’ll give it a try.   How about starting with informational interviews? You could reach out to people and ask for a short chat about their experiences.   Exactly! It’s a low-pressure way to make connections. Would you be willing to try reaching out to a couple of people this week?   I can do that. I’ll try to find a few contacts.   I like that. I can invite them over after I prepare some meals.   I think the networking and meal prepping are good focuses.
