History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been a mixed bag, honestly. I went to a film event, but I felt really anxious.   I struggled to talk to anyone. I felt like I was just standing there, watching.   I think it’s just my shyness. I keep thinking no one will want to talk to me.   I was disappointed in myself. I wanted to connect but didn’t know how.   I’ve been more aware of my anxiety, but I still feel overwhelmed sometimes.  "
