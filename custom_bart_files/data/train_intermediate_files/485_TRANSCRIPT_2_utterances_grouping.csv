History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey! It’s been pretty good, actually. I tried going to a game night, just like we talked about. It was a lot of fun! I met some really cool people, and we played a bunch of games together. Honestly, it felt so refreshing. I was nervous at first, but once we started playing, it felt natural. I did! I talked about moving to L.A. and how I’m getting used to everything. They seemed interested. Yeah, surprisingly. It felt good to talk about it. It makes me feel less isolated. I’m really happy about it. Yes, I called my parents last weekend. It was really nice to hear their voices. It was good. We talked about everything, and I felt a bit more grounded afterward. I think it’ll help a lot. Just knowing I can talk to them whenever I want makes it easier. I guess I’m not sure where to start. There are so many opportunities, but I don’t know which ones to pursue. I feel good about it. It gives me something to work toward."

Next Steps,"Maybe I could organize another game night or something.  I could create a group chat or something. It would be easier to coordinate. Yeah, I’m thinking about making it a regular thing, like every Sunday. Yeah, I’ve considered that. I think I need to refine my portfolio too. Sure! I could work on updating my portfolio and applying to a few jobs. Maybe three or four? That feels manageable."
