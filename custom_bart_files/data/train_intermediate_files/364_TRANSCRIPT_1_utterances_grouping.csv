Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,I’d like to talk more about my work-life balance and how to manage stress better.
Trauma History,I’ve been thinking about my past therapy experiences and how they’ve shaped my views on mental health.
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, work has been a bit overwhelming. The regulations in California are tough, and I’m feeling the pressure of running the family business. Just trying to keep up with the changes and making sure we stay compliant while also being competitive. It feels like a lot of pressure. I’ve been trying to delegate more tasks to my team, but it’s hard to let go sometimes. I worry about things not being done the way I would do them."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I've been doing well, thank you. I had a nice weekend, did some hiking and spent time with my daughter. Yes, actually. There was a moment when we reached the top of the trail, and the view was breathtaking. It made me feel grateful for my health and the time I get to spend with my daughter. Yes, I have. I still wish we were closer, but I’m trying to accept that we are who we are."

Progress Evaluation,"It's been eye-opening. I realized how many small things I often overlook. It helps me shift my focus from stress to appreciation. Definitely. I feel lighter and more positive. I think it's helping me manage stress better. I used to think therapy was pointless, but now I see it as a valuable resource. I wish I had been more open to it earlier. I think life experiences and understanding that everyone has struggles helped. I realize it’s okay to seek help. I feel more open to it now. I think I’d like to have someone to talk to again if I face challenges."
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,I have! I started a gratitude journal. I've been writing down three things I'm grateful for every day. It’s natural to feel that way when you care about your business. Perhaps we can explore some techniques to help with delegation and trust-building in your team? One approach could be to start with small tasks and gradually increase their responsibilities as they build trust. How does that sound?
Next Steps,"Perfectionism can be a heavy burden. It's okay to accept that others may do things differently. Would you like to set a goal for delegating a specific task this week? Yes, I’ll try to delegate one task to a team member and see how it goes. Exactly! It opens the door for communication without the weight of expectations. Would you like to set a goal for reaching out this week? Yes, I’ll try to reach out to one of my brothers this week."
