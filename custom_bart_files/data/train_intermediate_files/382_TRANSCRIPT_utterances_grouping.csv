History of Present Illness (HPI),it's pretty challenging but it's uh fun uh took about a couple of years i feel like i'm pretty used to it now uh it depends on the situation i i can either be introverted or extroverted just given uh the right circumstance i like uh listening to music uh doing crossword puzzles reading and hanging out with friends on weekends uh very good i don't think it was argument maybe <may> maybe a difference of opinion so it was more like a debate but uh it was pretty pretty tame debate over sports over a basketball <ba> a basketball game i think talking <ta> talking about is healthy <hea> is healthy i probably could've been more disciplined growing up more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kinda thing probably leaving my comfort zone in uh south carolina moving out here that was pretty so it was it was a bittersweet feeling a lot of excitement mixed with uh some anxiety but it uh it went away pretty quickly not doing better in school uh when i was in high school uh definitely i could've been a a <ss> um more diligent worker and i could've uh applied myself a little bit better probably going back to school i wish i would've uh wish i would've done better in school so if i could take something back from my past it would be uh scholastically <sch> scholastically related uh no everything's pretty much uh the way it usually is with me i've been feeling pretty good i made a lot of money uh a few weeks ago and uh i feel like i'm ahead of the game with you know with having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so i'm still kinda have the lingering effects from that happiness when i have money i tend to be a lot uh more even-tempered not even-tempered but i tend to feel better about things and more optimistic and this city being such about your finances it it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game i think i'm creative and i think i'm a good listener to be as disciplined and focused as possible i wish i was more disciplined but i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better it's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older um i'm out of my twenties now so i definitely seen a change from when i first came out here some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was uh not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kinda made me feel bad but constructive criticism i'm proud that i've come a long way from when i first moved out here i'm uh a lot more disciplined i read a lot i do crosswords i think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want i'm not a big fan of high taxes i had a friend over at my apartment and i watched a movie and that was fun
