History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’m feeling pretty good. I’ve been working on my resume and applying for more jobs. A couple of places reached out, but I haven’t had any interviews yet. Just trying to stay positive. It helps clear my mind. I feel more relaxed when I’m surrounded by nature. It’s peaceful. Yes! I feel lighter, like I can let go of some stress. I think being outside really helps. Well, I had a moment last week when I felt really overwhelmed. I was thinking about my son again and it just hit me hard. I was sitting in my room, and I just started thinking about how long it’s been since I last saw him. I felt a wave of sadness wash over me.  It was about longing and hope. I wrote about the memories I have of him and how I’m waiting for the day we can see each other again."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,I remember taking him to the park when he was little. We’d play on the swings and laugh together. Those moments were special. I feel a mix of happiness and sadness. Happy for the memories but sad that I can’t create new ones right now. I hope so. I just want him to know I’m thinking about him.

Therapeutic Interventions,"Well, I try to keep myself busy. I write poetry and listen to music. I’ve also been going for walks in the park. I ended up writing a poem about it. It helped me express what I was feeling instead of bottling it up. Definitely. It’s like therapy for me. I can get everything out on paper and then feel lighter afterward. I’ve thought about writing him letters. I could send them to his last known address.  Yes, I think I would. It might help me feel closer to him, even if he doesn’t receive them right away."
Next Steps,That makes sense. I’ll look into local organizations that could use help. I like that idea. I’ll start researching this week. Of course! I’m here for you. Let’s set a goal for our next session. How about you write a letter to your son before we meet again? I can do that. I’ll bring it in to share if I feel comfortable.
