History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time you mentioned feeling pretty good overall. Has that continued?   Yes, mostly. I still have my ups and downs, but I’m trying to focus on the positives.   That's a great mindset. Have you noticed any specific triggers for your downs?   Sometimes it’s just the loneliness, especially when I think about my family back home.   That makes sense. Loneliness can be challenging. What have you been doing to cope with those feelings?   I’ve been trying to reach out more, like calling my daughters or friends.   That’s a wonderful strategy. How has that worked for you?   It helps, but sometimes I still feel a bit disconnected.   It’s understandable. Relationships can be complicated. Have you considered any new activities or hobbies to meet new people?   I’ve thought about joining a local club or class, maybe something related to art or fitness.   That sounds like a great idea! Engaging in activities can help you meet like-minded people. Do you have any specific classes in mind?   I saw a painting class at a community center that looked interesting.   Great! Last session, you mentioned your sleep was about fifty-fifty. Have you noticed any changes there?   That’s a positive step. Have you implemented any specific strategies to help with your sleep?   Excellent choice! Reading can be very calming. How has that been for you?   That’s wonderful to hear. Let’s continue to build on that. Is there anything else you’ve tried that’s helped?   Breathing exercises can be very effective. How do you feel when you do them?   Just the usual worries about my daughters.   Would you like to talk about those worries?   I just hope they’re doing okay. Sometimes I feel like I can’t be there for them.   It’s natural to worry about your loved ones. Have you been able to communicate with them about how you feel?   I haven’t really opened up about my worries.  "

Mental Health Observations,"As you breathe, notice how your body feels. Are there any areas of tension?   My shoulders feel a bit tight.  "
Physiological Observations,"It’s still hit or miss, but I’ve been trying to stick to a routine.   It’s nice. I feel more relaxed when I go to bed.   They really help calm my mind. I feel more centered afterward.   How do you feel now?   Much more relaxed. I like this.  "
Current Functional Status,I’ve started reading before bed instead of looking at my phone.   I’ve also been practicing some breathing exercises.

Therapeutic Interventions,"Wonderful. Let’s start with a simple exercise today. Would you like to try a short guided mindfulness session?   Sure, I’d like that.   Okay, let’s take a moment to close our eyes and focus on our breath. Inhale deeply… and exhale slowly.   Good awareness. As you exhale, imagine releasing that tension.   Wonderful. With each breath, you’re allowing your body to relax more.   Great! Let’s take a few more breaths together. Inhale… and exhale.  "
Next Steps,"That sounds lovely! Painting can be a great way to express yourself. Would you be open to signing up for that?   Yes, I think I will. It could be fun!   Fantastic! Let’s keep that as a goal for this week. How do you feel about that?   I feel good about it. I think it’ll be a nice change.   That’s great progress! Would you like to explore more techniques like that?   Yes, I’d love to.   Perfect! We can incorporate some mindfulness practices into our sessions. Would you be open to that?   Absolutely!   I’m glad to hear that. We can use this technique whenever you feel overwhelmed.   Yes, please. I think it could really help.   Excellent! Let’s also set a goal for you to practice this exercise at least a few times this week.   I can do that.   Would you be comfortable sharing your feelings with them?   I think I should. It might help both of us.   That sounds like a great step toward connection. How about we set that as a goal for this week too?   Yes, I’ll try to talk to them.   Let’s check in on these goals next session. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences!  "
