History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay. I’ve been trying to use the affirmations we talked about. It’s been good. I feel a little more positive, but there are days when I still doubt myself. I try to remind myself of my accomplishments, but sometimes it’s hard to shake off the negative thoughts. I applied to a couple of places, but I haven’t heard back yet. I feel good about them. I think I put my best foot forward. I have a few former classmates and some people from my volunteer work. It’s been a bit overwhelming with everything going on, but I’m managing. I guess I could focus on the quality time we spend together rather than material things. We like to go to the park and watch movies at home. Simple things, but we enjoy them."

Risk Assessment,"Yes, I think I could do that. It’s a bit intimidating, though. Sometimes I feel guilty about not being able to provide everything I want for my daughter."
Mental Health Observations,It feels calming. I like it. I notice the sound of the air conditioning and the sunlight coming through the window. I feel more relaxed. I think I could use this when I’m feeling anxious.

Therapeutic Interventions,Mindfulness can help you stay present and manage negative thoughts. Would you be interested in trying a short mindfulness exercise with me? Great! Let’s start by taking a few deep breaths together. Inhale deeply through your nose… hold it for a moment… and exhale slowly through your mouth. How does that feel?
Next Steps,"Absolutely! You can use mindfulness anytime. Would you like to set a goal to practice this daily? Yes, I’ll try to do it every morning. Maybe I could network more? I haven’t really reached out to anyone. It feels manageable. I’ll give it a shot! Those sound like lovely activities! Perhaps you can plan regular outings to strengthen your bond. Would you like to set a goal for that? Yes, I’d like to make it a weekly thing."
