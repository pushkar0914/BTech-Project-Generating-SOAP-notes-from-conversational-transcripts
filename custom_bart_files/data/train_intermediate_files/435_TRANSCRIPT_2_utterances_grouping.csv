History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been okay, a bit challenging, but I tried to stick to my goals.   I attempted to talk to my kids about my feelings, but it didn’t go as smoothly as I hoped.   They seemed distracted and didn’t really engage with what I was saying.   I felt disappointed and a bit rejected.   I wrote about my expectations and how I might need to adjust them.   I realized that I can’t control how they respond, but I can control how I communicate.   I’ve been trying to challenge my negative thoughts, but it’s tough.   I often think I’m not good enough for my job or my kids.   I’ve received positive feedback at work, and my kids often tell me they love me.   I’m excited but also a bit nervous.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,I went for a long walk and did some journaling afterward.   I could write them down and keep them somewhere visible.  
Next Steps,I think I’ll try to be more patient and maybe choose a better time to talk.   I want to focus more on my love for them and less on my worries.   I’ll definitely try that.   Maybe I could join a local group or class.   I’m thinking about a yoga class or a book club.   I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable and that everyone else is probably feeling the same way.   I think I can do that!
