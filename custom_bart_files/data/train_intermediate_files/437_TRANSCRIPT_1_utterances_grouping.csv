Therapeutic Interventions,"That's a positive step. Mindfulness can be really beneficial. Have you found any strategies that help you stay on track?   I’ve started meal prepping on Sundays, which helps. I also try to keep healthy snacks around.   Great! Have you tried any stress-relief techniques in the past?   I’ve done some yoga and meditation, but I haven’t been consistent.   That’s a great idea! Preparing can help reduce anxiety. Would you like to brainstorm some starters now?   How about asking people what their favorite travel destination is?   That’s a good one! People usually love talking about their travels.   Exactly! You could also ask about their favorite books or movies.  "

Morning routines can set a positive tone for the day. How would you feel about committing to that?   I think I can do that. I’ll start with just ten minutes a day.   Perfect!
