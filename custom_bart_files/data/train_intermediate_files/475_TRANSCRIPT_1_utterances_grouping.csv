History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay, just trying to manage everything with my wife being pregnant.   Excited, but also a bit overwhelmed.   I guess I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about being a good dad.   Just the pressure to provide and be there for my family.   Just trying to manage my feelings about the pregnancy and work-life balance.  "

Current Functional Status,"I’ve been reading parenting books and talking to friends who are already parents.   I’m not sure yet. I want to be there for my wife and the baby, but I also have work commitments.   Maybe to have flexible hours for a while after the baby arrives.   Um, well, I wanted to discuss my schedule once the baby arrives.   I’d like to request some flexibility in my hours to help support my wife and the baby.   Maybe starting earlier or later some days, depending on our needs.   I believe I can still meet my deadlines and stay productive.   I’ve been running more, but sometimes it’s hard to find the time.   Maybe in the mornings before work or even at the gym.  "
