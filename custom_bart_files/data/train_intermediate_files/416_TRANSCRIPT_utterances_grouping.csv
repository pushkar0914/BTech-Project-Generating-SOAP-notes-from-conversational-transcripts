History of Present Illness (HPI),about twenty five years ago <tisk> family i was a child it took a little adjustment but not hard i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago
Medical and Psychiatric History,astronomy no not at all never
Psychosocial History,actually i haven't been back <laughter> i like l_a i can't think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldn't wanna leave so my family is here so that's another reason why i wouldn't wanna leave i'm definitely more shy but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but initially i'm pretty shy i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me it's good it's very good we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's a good relationship i mean we we get along well could be i mean it's not it's not perfect but it's good good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well <tisk> um really really i mean we all feel happy every day at some point but really happy <sigh> it's probably been a while um probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy stuck to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less don't really matter i kinda live in the moment and then you kinda realize that five ten years have gone by and you should've done something <tisk> um my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends that've been positive influences mm a caring guy nice person good heart a little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to focus more on school i felt content after it <tisk> not much it's i mean it's kinda sad i don't know uh <laughter> i think i could do better i feel like i'm an underachiever so not much i don't know i'm very detail oriented organized i like to finish tasks um i care a lot you know i'm very caring um i have good intentions in mind i don't like to wrong people i don't like to lie because once you lie one lie leads to another so i don't like that
Risk Assessment,frustrated mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that argument with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she made me feel pretty bad <laughter> when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and my car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that stupid <laughter> immature <laughter>
