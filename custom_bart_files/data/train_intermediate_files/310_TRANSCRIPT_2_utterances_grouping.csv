History of Present Illness (HPI),"It was alright, I guess. I did try drawing a couple of times.   It was nice. I forgot how much I enjoyed it.   Yeah, it was a good distraction from everything else.   That sounds perfect! Sundays can be a good day to unwind. Did you experience any moments of feeling down this week?   I’ve been thinking about my job situation.   I’m just tired of being unemployed. I want to find something I actually enjoy.   I’d love to work in a record shop or something music-related.   A little. There aren’t many around here.  "

Next Steps,"I could try. Maybe an old friend.   Yeah, I have a friend from college I haven’t spoken to in a while.   It can be challenging. Would you be open to exploring online opportunities or even volunteering at a local shop to gain experience?   That might be worth considering.   It could be a great way to meet people and get your foot in the door. Just remember to take it step by step.   Yeah, I’ll think about it.  "
