History of Present Illness (HPI),"I feel calmer throughout the day. It helps me focus better, especially when I’m working. Yes! When I start feeling overwhelmed at work, I take a few minutes to breathe and refocus. It makes a difference. It went really well. I told her how I’ve been feeling a bit lost after graduation, and she reassured me that it’s normal. I still have my moments, but talking about it helped. I’m starting to feel more inspired to explore job opportunities."

Psychosocial History,"Hey Ellie! I’ve been doing well. Finals are finally over, and I’m enjoying my time off before graduation. I did! She was really supportive and even mentioned wanting to try it with me. I’ve been researching positions in marketing and management. I think those align with my studies. I haven’t yet, but I think I should. I have a few connections from school that could help. We’ve been spending more time together, and it’s been great. We went hiking last weekend. It felt refreshing. Being in nature always lifts my mood, and we had some great conversations. Not really. We’ve been good at communicating, and I’m trying to be more open about my feelings. I think just maintaining that open communication. I want us to keep growing together. A little bit. We talked about traveling more after graduation, which we’re both excited about. We’re thinking about a road trip along the coast or maybe even a trip to Europe someday. It makes me feel hopeful. I love having things to look forward to."
