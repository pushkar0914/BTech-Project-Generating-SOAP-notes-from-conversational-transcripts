History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I’ve been okay. I reached out to a couple of old colleagues. It was nerve-wracking, but I did it. One of them responded positively. I felt relieved, like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I’m going to meet one of them for coffee next week. I want to catch up and see if they know of any job openings. I did! I wrote down my thoughts, but I haven’t sent it yet. I’ve felt a bit more hopeful since reconnecting with my colleagues."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Mindfulness can be a powerful tool for managing stress and anxiety. Would you be open to trying a simple mindfulness exercise together now? Sure, I’d like that. Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on our breath. Inhale deeply through your nose… and exhale slowly through your mouth.  Let’s do that a few more times. As you breathe, allow yourself to let go of any tension. "
Next Steps,Exactly! You deserve to be heard. How about setting a goal to send that message by the end of the week? I think I can do that.  I want to send that message to my family and see how my meeting goes with my colleague.
