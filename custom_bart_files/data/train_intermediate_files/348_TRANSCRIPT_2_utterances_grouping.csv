History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been trying to practice the mindfulness you suggested. It’s been... interesting. At first, it was hard to focus, but I started to feel a little more relaxed after a few tries. That’s a positive sign! It’s normal for it to feel challenging at first. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or how you cope since starting? A little. I think I’m more aware of when I start to feel overwhelmed, which is a start. I did talk to my daughter a little. I told her I’ve been feeling down. She was really supportive. It felt good. I was nervous at first, but it was nice to let some of it out. I’m still struggling with feeling stuck, especially with work. I feel unmotivated. I think it’s just the same routine every day. It feels monotonous, and I don’t feel challenged anymore. I think I’d like to take on more project management tasks. I enjoy organizing and leading. I think that’s it for now. I feel a little more hopeful about things."

Therapeutic Interventions,I try to take a moment to breathe and remind myself to stay in the present. It helps a bit. How about we work together to create a plan? We can outline what you’d like to discuss and how you might frame it. 
Next Steps,Maybe in the next couple of weeks? I want to feel prepared.
