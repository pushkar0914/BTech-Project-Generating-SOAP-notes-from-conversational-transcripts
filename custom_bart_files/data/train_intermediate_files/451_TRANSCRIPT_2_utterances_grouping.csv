History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been really nice. I forgot how much I enjoy expressing myself that way. It feels freeing. Yes, I think I feel a bit more independent. It’s like I’m finding joy in my own space, which is new for me. It’s a relief, honestly. I feel less anxious about being alone and more excited about what I can create. Yes, I had a small argument with a family member. I felt the anger bubbling up, but I remembered to take a breath and respond calmly. I felt proud of myself. It was nice to not let the anger control me. I want to keep improving. It’s nice to feel in control of my reactions. It feels exciting! I’m looking forward to it."

Current Functional Status,"Hi! I’ve been okay. I’ve been trying to do some painting and writing like we talked about. There was a moment when I wanted to call a friend to hang out, but I decided to stay home and paint instead. I felt good about that choice."

Next Steps,I’d like to practice pausing for a moment before reacting in any situation that frustrates me. Maybe I can set reminders on my phone or use sticky notes around the house. I think I’ll set aside specific times during the week to paint or write. Maybe twice a week?
