History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's good to hear. Last time, you mentioned feeling tired and having trouble sleeping. Have there been any changes in that?   A little bit, but I still struggle to sleep well. I think it's the cold weather and my situation.   I see. Have you tried any strategies to help improve your sleep?   I’ve tried to keep a routine, but it’s hard when I’m not in a stable place.   Excellent. You mentioned feeling a bit down sometimes about not starting things sooner. Can you tell me more about that?   Yeah, I just think about how much I could’ve accomplished if I had started earlier.   I just try to push through and focus on what I can do now.   Sometimes I get distracted easily, especially when I’m tired.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Great! One thing we can try is mindfulness or relaxation exercises before bed. Have you ever practiced mindfulness?   It can be quite helpful. It involves focusing on your breath and being present in the moment. Would you like to try a brief exercise now?   Alright, let's take a deep breath in through your nose... and out through your mouth. How does that feel?   Good! You can use that technique whenever you feel overwhelmed or before going to sleep.  "
Next Steps,It could be a nice way to get out and meet people. Let’s set a goal for you to look up some events this week. How does that sound?   I’m glad to hear that. Remember to practice the mindfulness exercise and look into those events. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
