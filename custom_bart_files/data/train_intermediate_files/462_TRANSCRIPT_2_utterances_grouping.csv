History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay. I reached out to Sarah, and we talked for a bit. It felt good to talk to her. She was really supportive and understood what I’m going through. Yeah, definitely. It felt nice to share my feelings with someone who gets it. I’m excited! I think it’ll be good to have some fun and take my mind off things. It’s still stressful, but I feel like I’m handling it better. I’m trying to focus on what I can control. I’ve started to limit conversations with my mom. It’s hard, but I know it’s necessary. It feels empowering. I’m tired of letting her affect my mood. I think so. I just need to stay firm and not let her manipulate me. I will. I’m learning that it’s okay to ask for help."

Next Steps,"I want to keep working on my self-care routine and maybe explore more coping strategies for the custody battle. I’d like that! Maybe I can try yoga or something relaxing. Okay, I’ll look for a class or some online videos."
