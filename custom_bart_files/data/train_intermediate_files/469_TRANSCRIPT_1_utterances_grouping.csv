History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie! I’ve been okay, a bit of a rollercoaster honestly. Well, I had some moments where I felt really anxious, especially with work and finances. Just the uncertainty of it all, you know? I’m worried about my job security and how to manage my expenses. I think I need to do that. Sometimes I hesitate, but I know it would help. Yes, actually. I had a confrontation with a rude driver, and I felt that familiar anxiety creeping in. It’s been on my mind more. I’m starting to feel lonely, especially when I see couples around. Yeah, someone who’s funny, kind, and adventurous, like me!"

Psychosocial History,Just being around friends and the energy in the room. It reminded me how important social interactions are for me. I miss the companionship and having someone to share experiences with.

Mental Health Observations,"They helped clear my head a little. I noticed some nice things around my neighborhood, which was calming. Yes! I went to a comedy show with friends last weekend, and it felt so good to just laugh and enjoy the moment. A bit nervous, but also excited. I think it’ll be good to reconnect. I took a deep breath and tried to let it go, but it was tough. I felt my heart racing. A bit shaky, but I tried to distract myself afterward with music. I feel a bit more hopeful about it. It’s nice to think about possibilities. Excited and a little nervous, but I think it’ll be good for me."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Yeah, I’ve been trying to breathe deeply when I feel overwhelmed, and I went for a walk a couple of times. I’ve been trying to watch some funny shows. Laughter really helps! I could remind myself that they’ll be happy to hear from me. And I can just be myself. I do! I like upbeat songs that make me feel good."
Next Steps,"It’s great that you recognize that. Would you be open to setting a goal for this week around connecting with friends? Sure! Maybe I can plan to call one friend and invite them out. I could try joining some local clubs or groups that align with my interests. Hope is powerful. Let’s set a goal for you to explore one new activity this week. What do you think? Yes, I’d like that! I’ll look for a local hiking group."
