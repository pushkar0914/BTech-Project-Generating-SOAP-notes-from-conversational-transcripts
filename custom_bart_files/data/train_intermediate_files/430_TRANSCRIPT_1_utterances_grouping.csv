History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's understandable. Last time, we talked about your experiences with depression and how therapy has helped you manage your temper. Have you noticed any changes since then? Yeah, I think I've been able to step back a bit more during tense moments. It’s still a work in progress, but I’m getting there. Well, I had a minor disagreement with my roommate again, but instead of getting defensive, I just listened to her. It felt good not to escalate things. Honestly, it felt liberating. I didn’t realize how much energy I wasted on being angry. Definitely. It distracts me from my own worries and gives me something to look forward to. Sometimes, it can be emotionally draining. I get attached, and it’s hard to let them go. I try to remind myself that I’m helping them find a better life. It helps me let go. I’ve been trying mindfulness techniques. I’ve started meditating for a few minutes each day. It’s challenging to quiet my mind, but I feel calmer afterward. I think it’s helping."

Psychosocial History,"I think so. I’ve been trying to focus more on my hobbies, like fostering dogs. It gives me a sense of purpose. Yes! I just rescued a little terrier mix last week. She was so scared, but after a few days, she started warming up to me. It’s been rewarding. It feels amazing. I love seeing them go to good families. It’s like I’m making a difference, even if it’s small."
