History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing well. I actually started working on my website! It was a bit overwhelming at first, but once I started, it felt good. I’ve got a basic layout done. It felt rewarding. I felt proud of myself for taking that step. I shared it with a couple of friends, and they were really supportive. It felt good to have their encouragement. I want to start adding some of my best photos and maybe write a little about my photography journey. I’m a bit nervous about it. I’m not sure if my story is interesting enough. I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about my financial situation still. "

Next Steps,"I guess I should just write it down and not overthink it.  Maybe I could set aside some time this week to just brainstorm ideas. That sounds like a productive plan. How about we set a goal for you to write a draft of your story by our next session? I think I can do that!  I’ve been considering looking for part-time work to help with the income. Maybe something related to photography or even retail. Just something to bring in extra money. Yes, maybe I could aim to apply for a couple of part-time jobs by next week."
