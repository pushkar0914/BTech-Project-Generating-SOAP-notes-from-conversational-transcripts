History of Present Illness (HPI),"I had a tough assignment last week, but I reached out for help, which I usually don’t do. It was a bit uncomfortable at first, but it turned out to be really beneficial. I learned a lot more than I expected. I think I could work on being more assertive, especially in group settings. I sometimes worry about how others will react, and I don’t want to create conflict. I think that would be helpful. It could prevent misunderstandings from building up."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One technique is to practice “I” statements, similar to what you did with your husband. This can help you communicate your feelings without sounding confrontational. How do you feel about trying that? I think that could work for me. I’ll practice using “I” statements in group discussions. Excellent! Another technique is to prepare what you want to say in advance. This can help reduce anxiety. Would you be comfortable trying that? Yes, I’ll give it a shot. I think it could help me feel more prepared."
Next Steps,Maybe once a week? Just to touch base and see how we’re both feeling.
