Psychosocial History,originally i'm from well i was born in mississippi so i'm from gulfport mississippi  i didn't have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents  uh when i was two years old  yes i like to travel and i travel a lot  um being around new environments and new people uh different things  um well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people  a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way   i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that    i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i don't know   uh i think i'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day  there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences  well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her  because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children  and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to   you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to  you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays  uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  help someone else improve and better themself as well
