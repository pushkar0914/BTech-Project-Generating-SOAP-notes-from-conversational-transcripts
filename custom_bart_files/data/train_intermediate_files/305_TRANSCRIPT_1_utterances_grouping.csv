History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’m excited but also a bit nervous. It’s been a while since I worked in a structured environment. I hope it helps. I think being employed will ease some of the tension. I’ve been feeling a bit like a burden lately. Not really. I don’t want her to worry more. I just try to put on a brave face. I think she’d be understanding. She’s supportive, but I just don’t want to add to her stress. Great. Have you had any moments of anxiety or frustration since we last talked? A bit, yeah. Mostly when I think about my past and how it affects my job search. Well, I still have that nagging doubt that employers will judge me for my history. It feels like a shadow that follows me. Yeah, I just wish I could shake it off.  Yeah, I often start thinking about my past mistakes and what could have been different. I think I do that “all-or-nothing” thing a lot. Like, I feel like I’m either completely successful or a total failure."

Physiological Observations,"Good. Let’s check in on your sleep. Has it improved at all since we last spoke? A little, I guess. I’m still waking up a lot, but I’m managing to fall asleep faster. I’ve been trying to limit screen time before bed. It seems to help a bit."
Current Functional Status,"Hey, Ellie. I've been okay, I guess. Just trying to keep busy with job applications and stuff. Yeah, I did! They actually offered me a part-time position. I start next week. I think just getting back into a routine. Plus, it'll be nice to have some income coming in again."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Sometimes I just distract myself with painting or cooking. It helps, but it’s not always enough. Those are great outlets. Would you be open to trying mindfulness techniques to help you stay grounded in those moments? Sure, I’m willing to try that. One technique is to focus on your breathing. When you feel overwhelmed, take a moment to breathe deeply, in through your nose and out through your mouth.  I can do that. I’ve heard about mindfulness before but never really practiced it. It’s all about being present and acknowledging your thoughts without judgment. You might find it helpful. I’ll give it a shot.  It’s common to ruminate on those thoughts. Would you like to explore ways to challenge those thoughts? Sure, I’d like that.  One approach is to ask yourself if those thoughts are based on facts or feelings. Can you identify any cognitive distortions?"
Next Steps,Let’s set a goal for the next week. How about practicing mindfulness for a few minutes each day? I can do that.  Wonderful! And perhaps you can also try to share your feelings with your girlfriend about your job search and how you feel. That sounds doable. I’ll try to talk to her this weekend.
