History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been a bit better, but still not where I want it to be. I think the weather is still affecting me too. A little. I’m still waking up at night, but I’ve been trying to relax more before bed. I’ve thought about it, but it’s hard to resist temptation, especially with all the food options around. I love fruits! Vegetables, on the other hand, I struggle with a bit."
Medical and Psychiatric History,"Oh, hi! I've been okay, I guess. Still dealing with the thyroid issue, but I’m trying to manage it. Yes, I had an appointment last week. They adjusted my medication, so I’m hoping that helps."
Psychosocial History,"It’s been okay. I’ve been trying to reach out more to my brother. We had a nice chat last week. Yes, it felt good to catch up. I miss those conversations. I think I might reach out to my sister too. We haven’t talked in a while."
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,It definitely lifts my spirits a bit. I feel more energized and less sluggish.

Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,I’ve been trying to get outside more when the sun does come out. Even just for a short walk helps. I’ve been listening to calming music and doing some light reading before bed.
Next Steps,"Maybe setting a specific time each day to walk could help. I need to make it a priority. That sounds like a good plan. How about we set a small goal for this week? Perhaps aim for walking at least three times? Yes, that sounds manageable. I think I can do that! It might take some time to adjust. Have you thought about keeping a sleep diary to track your patterns? I haven’t, but that could be helpful to see if there are any patterns. Yes, it could provide insight into what might be affecting your sleep. Would you like to try that? Sure, I can start that this week. Maybe meal prepping could be a good idea. That way, I have healthy options ready. Meal prepping is a fantastic strategy! It can save time and help you stick to your goals. Would you like to set a goal for that as well? Yes, I’d like to try that! Maybe I can start with prepping for two days a week. That’s completely normal. How about trying to incorporate one new vegetable each week? I could do that! It might help me discover some new favorites. I’ll definitely try to do that."
