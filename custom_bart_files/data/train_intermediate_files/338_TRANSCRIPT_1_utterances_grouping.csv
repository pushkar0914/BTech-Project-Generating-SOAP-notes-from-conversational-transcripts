History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I think it helps a bit. I feel a little less heavy, if that makes sense. I’ve been trying to meditate a little. It’s hard to quiet my mind, but I’m working on it. I think just sitting still and not letting my thoughts race. I’ve always been someone who thinks a lot. I’ve been feeling a bit down again. I think about my mom a lot, especially when I’m alone. I just feel this emptiness. Sometimes I think about what she would say to me if she were here. I think she’d tell me to keep pushing through, to not let sadness take over. She always believed in me. It makes me feel warm, but also sad. I miss her so much. I’ve considered doing something in her name, like volunteering or something. Maybe something with kids, like tutoring or mentoring. She loved teaching."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s understandable. It’s common for people to struggle with stillness. Perhaps we can explore some techniques to help with that. Would you be open to trying some guided meditations together? Sure, I’d be willing to try that. That’s a common fear. It’s important to remind yourself that feelings are temporary, and with time and effort, they can change. Would you like to explore some techniques to help manage those worries? Sure, that would be helpful. Let’s practice some grounding techniques that can bring you back to the present moment when those worries arise. Would you like to try one now? Yes, I’d like that. Okay, let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale slowly... and exhale. Focus on the sensations of your breath. "
Next Steps,"That aligns beautifully with her legacy. It could also provide you with a sense of connection and purpose. Would you like to set a goal to explore volunteering in the next week? Yeah, I think that would be good for me. I’m glad to hear that! You can use this technique anytime you feel overwhelmed. Let’s make it a goal for you to practice this daily. How does that sound? Sounds good to me."
