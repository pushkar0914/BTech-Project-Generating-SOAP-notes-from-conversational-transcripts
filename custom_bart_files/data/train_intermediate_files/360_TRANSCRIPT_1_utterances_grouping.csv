It’s a bit frustrating, honestly. I just want to find something soon.   Great! Let’s check in on that next time. You mentioned feeling down sometimes. Can you tell me more about that?

Have you considered setting small daily goals for your job search?   I haven’t, but that sounds like a good idea.   It can help break things down into manageable steps. For example, you could aim to apply to one job a day or update your resume.   Yeah, I think I could do that.   Let’s set a goal for you to reach out and plan something. How does that sound?   I just tried to breathe and not let it get to me.   That’s a great approach. Breathing exercises can be very effective. Would you like to learn some new techniques?   Okay! We can try a simple mindfulness technique today. It can help you feel more centered.   Let’s take a few moments to focus on your breathing together. Inhale deeply…   And exhale slowly…   I’m glad to hear that! Practicing this regularly can help you manage those feelings of frustration and annoyance.  "
