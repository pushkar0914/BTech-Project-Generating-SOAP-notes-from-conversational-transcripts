History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay. I tried some of the grounding exercises during my walks. It really helped. I was able to focus on my surroundings, and it made me feel less anxious. Yeah, I had a tough day where I felt really overwhelmed. I tried to use the techniques, but it was hard. I had a lot of things on my mind. I felt stressed about finding a new therapist and some family stuff. I did! I tried to listen more during our conversations, but my sister still got upset. I just stayed calm and didn’t argue back. I think it helped diffuse the situation a bit. Yes, I found a couple of options, but I’m still nervous about reaching out. Sure. “I’m hoping to manage my PTSD symptoms better and improve my coping skills.” I guess I’m just worried about opening up to someone new. I feel hopeful. I think I’m ready to reach out."
