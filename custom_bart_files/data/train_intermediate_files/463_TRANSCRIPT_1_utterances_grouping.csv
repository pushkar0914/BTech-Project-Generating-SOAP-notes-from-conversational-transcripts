History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! I’ve been okay, just busy with work and waiting for my nursing license. It’s been alright. I still work at the retail store, but I’m finding it a bit exhausting. I guess I’m just worried about the future. I want to start my career as a nurse soon."

Therapeutic Interventions,That makes sense. Maybe we could explore some relaxation techniques that could help you unwind before bed? Great! One technique is progressive muscle relaxation. Have you heard of it before? It involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body. This can help reduce tension and prepare you for sleep. Would you like to try it together? It’s important to remember that everyone has limits. Asking for support doesn’t mean you’re not capable. Would you like to role-play that conversation?
Next Steps,"I think I can do that. I’ll try it tonight. Maybe I could take short breaks to breathe and calm down when I feel overwhelmed. I could start updating my resume and looking for job openings. Yes, I’ll aim to update my resume by the end of the week. Great! I’m looking forward to hearing how that goes. Let’s wrap up for today. Remember to practice the relaxation technique and consider having that conversation with your manager. "
