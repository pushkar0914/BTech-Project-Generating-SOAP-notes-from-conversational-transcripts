History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, sometimes we have different visions for what it should look like, and that can lead to some heated discussions. Usually, I feel a bit drained. But when we reach a compromise, it feels rewarding."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Yeah! I've been working on this art project with my friends. It's a mural in our neighborhood, and it's turning out really well. It feels incredible. It's like we all bring our own energy and ideas to the table, and it just clicks.  I try to stay calm and listen to everyone’s ideas. But I admit, I get a bit defensive about my vision sometimes. I think I’m pretty good at talking, but sometimes I struggle with listening. I guess I get caught up in my own thoughts and what I want to say next.  Not really. I still keep in touch with my brother, and we have a good time. My mom is still… well, my mom. It’s complicated. I love her, but she drives me a bit crazy sometimes. I think I’m content for now. I don’t want to force anything that isn’t there. We’ve been hanging out more! She’s really inspiring, and I feel like I can be myself around her. She brings out a side of me that I didn’t know existed. It’s like she helps me see the world through a different lens. Not yet. I’m a bit shy about expressing that kind of stuff."
Risk Assessment,I guess I’m afraid of being vulnerable and getting rejected.

Physiological Observations,I’ve been listening to some calming music before bed. It helps a bit. I feel energized and ready to tackle the day. It’s such a difference from when I don’t sleep well.

Therapeutic Interventions,"Yeah, I think I could practice being more open to suggestions. Maybe even suggest a brainstorming session next time. Not really. I’ve heard about it, but I haven’t given it a shot. We could start with a short breathing exercise. Just take a few deep breaths and focus on your breath for a minute or two. It can help ground you. Sounds easy enough. I’ll give it a try. Maybe I should try to set a consistent bedtime. That might help."
Next Steps,Consistency can be very beneficial! Let’s make that a goal for you this week.  Sounds good! I’ll aim for that. I want to work on being more open in conversations and maybe try that mindfulness exercise.
