History of Present Illness (HPI),uh very easy well maybe somewhat easy the beginning the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks it was great well it's something i'd wanted to do since i was twelve and everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream well it's kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was once i had done that work i realized that's not really what i wanted to do it was too cut-throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me it didn't make me happy more shy <sigh> partly the first thing i think of is 'cause i've always been that way i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people <deep breath> pretty good it depends on the situation but most of the time i'm pretty good <deep breath> um i don't think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations but not at people directly <sigh> <deep breath> noise other people's noise makes me really mad um i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and about their neighbors that that just makes me really mad <sigh> well the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is is when i bought my condo it felt like a really hard decision at the time you know i didn't know that i could do it i didn't wasn't sure if i had the money to do it um so that felt like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that <deep breath> for the most part good i'm i'm just really worried about money <sigh> at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say that i'm like great but i it's 'cause i am worried but you know i'm also confident that things are gonna work out they would say um reliable loyal <sigh> considerate and thoughtful well there's uh you know the normal things like i'd lose more weight and i would um think be a little more fearless maybe <sigh> be a little more bold
