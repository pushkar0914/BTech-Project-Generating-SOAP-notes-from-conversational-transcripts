Trauma History,Nothing reported

History of Present Illness (HPI),"It was a bit emotional, but I felt really good afterward. It was nice to reflect on my journey. I’ve been trying to take breaks and focus on one thing at a time, but it’s still tough. I’ve been meaning to get back into meditation. I used to find it really helpful."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I feel excited! I think it adds a personal touch to my website. Yes, I uploaded a few of my favorite nature shots. I think they complement the story well. They’ve been really supportive! A couple of them even offered to share my website with their networks. I’m thinking about using social media more actively, maybe doing a little campaign to share my work. I would tell them to embrace their passion and just go for it!"
Risk Assessment,"I’m a bit nervous about putting myself out there, but I think it’s worth it. I guess I should remind myself that it’s okay to take risks and that not everyone will judge me."
