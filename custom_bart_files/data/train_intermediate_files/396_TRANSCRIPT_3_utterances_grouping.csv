History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay, a bit up and down with everything.   Mostly just worry about my mother-in-law and how it’s affecting my wife.   She has her good days and bad days. I try to be there for her, but sometimes I feel helpless.   We’ve talked a bit, but I think we could communicate more.   A bit nervous, but also hopeful.   I feel a little more balanced, but I still have moments of anxiety.   Mostly when I think about the future and what might happen.   Just feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything.  "
