History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey Ellie! I've been okay, just dealing with finals and everything. A bit stressed, but I’m excited to be done with school soon. They went alright, I think. I was really nervous, but I tried to manage my time better this time around. I made a study schedule and stuck to it. I also tried to take regular breaks, which helped a lot. Yeah, I found that studying in groups was really helpful. We could quiz each other and explain things that we didn’t understand. A huge relief! I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I’m looking forward to my trip to Maui. Just relaxing on the beach, spending time with my girlfriend, and exploring the island. It’s been a while since we had a vacation together. I feel free and happy. It’s nice to escape from everyday life and just enjoy the moment. Sometimes, but I can get caught up in thinking about what’s next, like work or school. I’ve heard about mindfulness but haven’t really tried it. I’m not sure how to start. It feels calming, actually. I didn’t realize how much I was holding onto. Yeah, I’d like that. I think it could help with my stress. It’s alright. I’m still working part-time at the law firm, and it’s been busy. I’m trying to balance that with school. I try to prioritize my assignments and communicate with my boss about my availability. It’s not always easy, though. Communication is key. Have you felt overwhelmed at work lately? Not really. I usually just push through it, but maybe I should look into some techniques. Maybe just how I’m feeling a bit lost after graduation and how I want to find my motivation again."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Mindfulness can be as simple as focusing on your breath or observing your surroundings. Would you like to try a brief exercise together? Okay, let’s take a moment. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable. Take a deep breath in… and out. Focus on the sensation of your breath.  Great. Now, notice any sounds around you. What do you hear? Perfect. Just allow those sounds to be there without judgment. How does that feel? That’s a wonderful realization. Mindfulness can help you release tension. Would you be open to practicing it more regularly? That’s a good idea! We can explore some coping strategies together. For instance, taking short breaks can really help reset your mind."
Next Steps,"Great! Let’s set a goal for you to practice mindfulness for a few minutes each day. How does that sound? That sounds doable! I’ll give it a try. I can see how that would be helpful. I’ll try to implement that. It’s understandable to feel that way, but sharing your feelings could strengthen your bond. Would you consider discussing it with her? Yeah, I think I should. It might help to talk it out. I’m glad to hear that! For our next session, we can check in on your mindfulness practice and how the conversation with your girlfriend went. Does that sound good?"
