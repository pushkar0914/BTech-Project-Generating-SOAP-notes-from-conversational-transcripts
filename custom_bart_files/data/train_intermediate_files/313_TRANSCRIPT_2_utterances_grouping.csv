History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie. Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I’ve had some good days, but the stress is still there. I’ve been trying to stick to my morning routine and the breathing exercises we talked about. I think it helps a little. I feel more grounded, but it’s still tough when work gets hectic. I still forget to do the exercises sometimes, especially when I’m busy. Yes, I talked to my best friend, and it went surprisingly well. He was really supportive. It felt good, actually. I was nervous at first, but it was nice to share what I’ve been going through. He just reminded me that it’s okay to ask for help and that I’m not alone in this. I think I’m feeling more open to it now. I realize it’s not a burden. I feel more motivated, actually. It’s nice to have something to focus on outside of work stress. I feel a bit nervous, but I also think it could be really rewarding."

Next Steps,"Yeah, I think so. Maybe I could set a specific time for them. That sounds like a solid plan. You could also try pairing it with another habit, like brushing your teeth or drinking your coffee. I’ll definitely give that a try. I’d like to brainstorm some ideas and maybe figure out what steps I need to take next. I’m really interested in starting an online business, maybe something related to fitness or wellness. I’m not entirely sure yet. Maybe something that combines fitness with mental wellness? That sounds like a valuable niche, especially given your experiences. You could explore creating content around that theme or even offering coaching services. That’s a great idea! I hadn’t thought of coaching. It could be fulfilling to share your journey and help others. Would you like to explore how you could start small with that? Yes, I’d love to! We could brainstorm some content ideas or even consider starting a blog or social media presence to share your insights.  That sounds doable. I think I could start with social media. Fantastic! For our next session, we can check in on your progress with the exercises, your networking efforts, and how you’re feeling overall."
