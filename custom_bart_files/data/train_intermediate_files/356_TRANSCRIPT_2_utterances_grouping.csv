History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing a bit better, actually. I started working on my photography project. Yes, definitely. I feel more motivated and less weighed down by negative thoughts. A little, but I’ve been able to redirect my focus more easily. It’s still there, but it doesn’t consume me as much. I think it happens more when I’m alone for too long or when I’m not busy."

Mental Health Observations,"It feels really good. I love having a place where I can focus on my photography without distractions. It went really well! We laughed a lot, and I got some great shots. It felt good to be in that creative flow again. I think it helps me be more present. I notice more details and feel less rushed."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I have! I’ve been doing it before I start shooting, and it helps me focus. I’ve been reminding myself to think about my photography or even just going for a walk to clear my mind."
Next Steps,"I could make a list of landmarks I want to shoot and plan out some times to go. That’s a great plan! Setting specific goals can help keep you motivated. How about we set a goal for you to photograph at least two landmarks in the next week? I like that idea! I’ll aim for that. Sure! I could go for a walk, call a friend, or pick up a book to read. I’ll make that list. It’ll be helpful."
