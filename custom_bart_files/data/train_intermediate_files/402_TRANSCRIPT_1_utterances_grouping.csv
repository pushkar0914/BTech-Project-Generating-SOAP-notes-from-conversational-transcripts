History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, I’ve been okay. A bit up and down, but overall, I’m trying to focus on the positive. That’s great to hear. Last time, you mentioned feeling better with the change in weather. Have you been able to maintain that positivity? That’s fantastic! Engaging in activities you enjoy can really help with mood. Have you noticed any changes in your overall feelings since joining the group? That’s a significant step forward. You mentioned loneliness last time. Have you been able to address that in other areas of your life? I think I’ve started to value my own needs more. I used to think I was a burden to others, but now I see that friendships are mutual. I think I still struggle with self-doubt, especially regarding my career path. I often question if I’m capable of pursuing my interests in animals. I worry I might fail."

Current Functional Status,"Yes, definitely! I’ve been walking my dog more, and I even started going to a local hiking group. It’s been really nice. I met some new people, and it feels good to be outdoors again. I forgot how much I love hiking. I feel more centered and less reactive. It’s like I can step back and observe my thoughts instead of getting caught up in them. Definitely. I had a tough conversation with my fiancé about finances, and instead of getting defensive, I stayed calm and listened. It was productive. We both shared our concerns, and I felt like we were really communicating. I have! I’ve been volunteering at an animal shelter on weekends, which feels fulfilling. It’s been really rewarding. I love being around the animals, and it feels good to contribute."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I usually remind myself that it’s okay to ask for help and that friends want to be there for each other. Yes, I think so. I’m trying to practice mindfulness when I feel overwhelmed. I’ve been doing some guided meditations, focusing on my breath. It helps calm my racing thoughts."
Next Steps,"That’s a great plan! Setting small, achievable goals can help you build momentum. Would you like to set a goal for this next week? Yes, I’d like to research some local courses or workshops related to animal care. That’s a perfect goal! How about we check in on that in our next session?"
