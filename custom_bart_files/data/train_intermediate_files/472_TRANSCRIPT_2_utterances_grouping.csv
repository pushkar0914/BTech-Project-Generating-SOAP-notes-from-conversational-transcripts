History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yes, I think it helped me process some feelings I had about wanting to escape the busyness of life.  I feel more relaxed and fulfilled. It’s like I’m reconnecting with a part of myself that I had neglected. Yes, I did it a few times, but I still struggle with consistency. I felt less guilty this week. I think having dedicated art time helped me feel more fulfilled. I often feel overwhelmed with deadlines and the pressure to produce quality work quickly. I usually just power through, but I know that’s not the healthiest approach. Yes, I think that could help. I tend to look at the big picture and feel overwhelmed."

Current Functional Status,"Hi, Ellie! It’s been pretty good. I managed to stick to my art schedule mostly. It felt really rewarding. I actually finished a piece I had been working on for a while. It was a landscape inspired by a trip I took to the mountains. I’m really happy with how it turned out. We had a lovely family walk, and I really enjoyed our movie night. It was nice to connect with everyone."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Maybe setting reminders on my phone could help? That’s a great idea! You could also try linking your mindfulness practice to another routine, like right after you finish dinner. It’s good that you recognize that. Let’s brainstorm some strategies together. How about breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts? Focusing on smaller steps can make it feel less daunting. Would you also consider setting aside a few minutes each day for a quick mindfulness break during work?"
Next Steps,Perfect! Let’s set a goal for you to try that this week. How about starting with two days where you take a five-minute break to breathe and refocus? I can do that!
