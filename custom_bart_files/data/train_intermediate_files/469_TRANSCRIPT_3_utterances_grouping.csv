History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been feeling pretty good! I went on another hike and met more people. It was even better! We had a picnic afterward, and I felt so connected to everyone. It made me feel really happy and included. I realized how much I’ve missed being around people. I had a stressful day at work last week, but I didn’t let it overwhelm me like I used to. It felt comforting. We talked about old times and shared a lot of laughs. Definitely. I think being around people who understand me helps a lot. I feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. I want to put myself out there, but I’m scared of rejection. I feel a bit nervous, but also excited about the possibilities."
