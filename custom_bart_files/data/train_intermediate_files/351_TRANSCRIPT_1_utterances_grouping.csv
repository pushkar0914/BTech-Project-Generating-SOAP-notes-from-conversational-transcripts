History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I've had some good moments, like spending time with friends, but I've also felt a bit more anxious about my work lately. I think it's the pressure to succeed in the music industry. I feel like I need to prove myself, and sometimes I doubt my abilities. I try to distract myself with music or go for walks with my dogs. But sometimes, those feelings just linger. Yeah, I often think, ""What if I'm not good enough?"" or ""What if I fail?"" It’s like a loop in my head. Well, I have had some positive feedback from clients and friends. They say they love my work. I guess I don’t have concrete evidence of that. It’s more of a fear than a reality."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Those thoughts can be quite powerful. Would you be open to trying some cognitive techniques to challenge those thoughts? Great! One technique is to identify evidence for and against those thoughts. For example, what evidence do you have that you are good enough? That’s excellent evidence! Now, what about the thought that you might fail? What evidence do you have for that? That’s a good start. Sometimes, incorporating a calming bedtime routine can help. Would you be willing to try some relaxation exercises before bed? Fantastic! We could also explore mindfulness techniques to help quiet your mind. Would you like to try a short mindfulness exercise right now?"
Next Steps,"Wonderful! You can practice this technique daily, even for just a few minutes. How do you feel about setting a goal to try this every night this week? That’s a solid goal. We can continue to explore strategies for building your confidence in our next sessions as well. "
