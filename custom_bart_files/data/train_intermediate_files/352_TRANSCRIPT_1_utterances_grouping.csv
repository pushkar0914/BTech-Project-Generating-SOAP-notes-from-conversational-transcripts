History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I've been doing pretty well, actually. The job is going well, and I've been feeling more positive.   That's great to hear! Last time, you mentioned feeling a lot of pressure when you were unemployed. How has that changed for you?   It’s like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel more motivated now. I actually enjoy going to work every day.   That’s insightful. You mentioned in our last session that you believe you struggle with depression. Have you had any thoughts about that recently?   I have. I still think about it, but I feel like I'm managing it better now. The job has really helped.   That’s a positive shift. Have you noticed any triggers that might still affect your mood?   Sometimes when I’m alone for too long, I start to feel down again. It's like I need to be around people to stay positive.  "
Medical and Psychiatric History,"I try to make time for reading and going to the beach, which I find really calming.   Mostly fiction, but I also enjoy psychology-related books. They help me understand myself better.  "

Progress Evaluation,That’s a great strategy! It seems like you’re applying some of the coping techniques we discussed last time.   That’s wonderful progress. Have you noticed any changes in how you react to stressors at work?   I’ve been handling stress better. I try to take a step back and breathe before reacting.   That’s a significant improvement! It sounds like you’re developing a healthier response to stress.   I think so! I feel more in control of my emotions now.

Therapeutic Interventions,"Yeah, I think so! I’ve been trying to be more mindful about my feelings and not let them overwhelm me.   Mindfulness is a powerful tool. Have you practiced any specific mindfulness exercises?   I’ve been doing some breathing exercises when I feel anxious, and it really helps me focus.  "
Next Steps,"That’s a great feeling to have. Is there anything specific you would like to work on in our next session?   I think I’d like to explore how to maintain this positivity, even when I face challenges.   Absolutely, that sounds like a good goal. We can also discuss ways to strengthen your social connections.   Yes, that would be helpful! I want to keep building those relationships.  "
