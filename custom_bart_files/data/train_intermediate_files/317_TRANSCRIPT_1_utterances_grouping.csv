History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I’ve thought about it a bit. It’s just hard to shake off that feeling, you know? I think I just got overwhelmed again. The little things started piling up, and it feels heavy. Just work stuff, or the lack of it, really. I feel stuck and it’s frustrating.  I’ve thought about looking for new jobs, but I just can’t find the energy to do it. Maybe if I had a clearer idea of what I want. I feel lost. Yeah, I think so. I want something creative, but I also want it to be stable. I want to be able to express myself, maybe through writing or film. Something that allows me to tell stories. I used to write a lot, but I haven’t in a while. I guess I could start again. I think it’s when I’m not doing much or when I’m just stuck at home. "

Therapeutic Interventions,That sounds like a wonderful idea! Writing could also be a therapeutic outlet for you. How do you feel about setting a goal to write something once a week? It sounds like being active or engaged helps combat those feelings. Would you be open to trying some small daily activities to break that cycle?
Next Steps,"That feels manageable. I think I could do that. Great! It could help you regain some motivation and clarity. How about we check in on that next session? Yeah, I could try that. Maybe going for a walk or doing yoga more regularly. That’s a great plan! How about setting a goal to do one of those activities several times a week? Okay, I can aim for three times a week."
