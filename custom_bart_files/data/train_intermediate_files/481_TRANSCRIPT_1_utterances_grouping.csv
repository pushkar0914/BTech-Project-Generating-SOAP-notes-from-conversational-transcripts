History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, thanks! I've been okay, just trying to process everything we talked about last time. I think the part about my music and how I feel about it. I realized I have a lot of expectations and pressure on myself. Well, I feel like I have to be successful right away, or else I’m wasting my time. I put a lot of pressure on myself to make it big. I guess it’s a mix of wanting to prove myself and the fear of disappointing my family. They have their own ideas of what success looks like. I try to distract myself with music or meditation, but sometimes it just feels overwhelming. Yeah, when I think about my future, like what I’m going to do next or if I’ll ever get to where I want to be. I’ve been doing some mindfulness exercises, but I still find it hard to stay focused. My mind wanders a lot. I’ve been working on some new songs, feeling a bit more inspired lately. It’s like I’m channeling my feelings into my music. It feels good! It’s like I’m releasing some of that pressure. But then I worry if it’s good enough. Sometimes, yeah. I’ll start a project and then get discouraged and abandon it. I guess I compare myself to others a lot. I see other musicians who are more successful, and I feel like I’m falling behind. I think I’d feel less stressed. I just need to remind myself that everyone has their own timeline."

Therapeutic Interventions,Maybe writing down my thoughts? I used to keep a journal.
Next Steps,"That’s a wonderful idea! Journaling can help you process your feelings and thoughts. Would you be willing to commit to writing a little each day? Yeah, I think I can do that. It might help clear my mind. Excellent! Let’s aim for a few minutes each day. How about we check in on this in our next session? Yeah, I could try to limit my social media time. That might help with the comparisons. Maybe just 30 minutes a day? I’ll try to focus on creating instead."
