History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been pretty good! I managed to have those conversations with my sons. They went better than I expected. I shared some of my own challenges, and they opened up about their struggles. My older son talked about work stress and balancing family life. My younger son shared his feelings about relationships. It felt liberating. I think it helped them see me as more relatable. Yes, I feel closer to both of them. They seem more willing to reach out when they need to talk. It makes me feel proud. I want them to know they can always come to me. Yes, I tend to snack when I’m bored or stressed, so I’ve been trying to find healthier alternatives. I’ve been feeling more balanced, but I still have moments of anxiety, especially about the future."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve considered trying yoga. I think it might help with relaxation. I think I’ll start with online sessions. I’m a bit shy about joining a class just yet. I’ve been practicing deep breathing exercises and going for walks to clear my mind. I haven’t, but I’m open to it. I think it could help me manage my anxiety better."
Next Steps,"That’s perfectly fine! Starting at your own pace is important. How do you feel about setting a goal to practice yoga a couple of times a week? I can definitely commit to that! I think it will help with my stress levels. Mindfulness can be a great tool. Would you like to set a goal to try a short daily meditation practice? Yes, I’d like to try that! Even just a few minutes a day could help. I’d love that! I’ll look for some apps or videos to help me get started."
