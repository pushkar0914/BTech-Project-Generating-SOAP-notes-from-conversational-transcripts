Therapeutic Interventions,I think I need to keep practicing these conversations and maybe even journal about my feelings. Journaling can be a great tool for processing your emotions. It can help you reflect on your experiences and understand your feelings better. 
Next Steps,Maybe I could share something small about myself with a friend and see how they respond. I have a friend I’ve known for years. I think I could try it with her. I want to check in on how the conversation with my friend goes and possibly explore more about why I feel the way I do about trust.
