History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster, to be honest. I tried journaling like you suggested. It was a bit weird at first, but I found it helpful. I wrote about my feelings regarding the breakup and some memories.  Yeah, I think I understand now that it’s okay to feel angry. I was trying to push it away, but it just kept coming back. That makes sense. I guess I need to remind myself that it’s okay to let go."

Current Functional Status,"It helped me focus and feel more present. I think it’s something I want to keep doing. I started brainstorming ideas for a short film! I’m excited about it but also a little intimidated. I want to do something about relationships, maybe a short story that reflects on love and loss.  Yeah, I think it could help me process things, too."

Next Steps,Absolutely! Creating art can be therapeutic. How about setting a small goal to write a scene or outline this week? I like that idea. I could dedicate some time to it this weekend.
