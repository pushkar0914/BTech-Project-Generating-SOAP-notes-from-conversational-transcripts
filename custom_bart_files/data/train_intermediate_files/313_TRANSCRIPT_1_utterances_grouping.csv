History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, um, I've been okay I guess. A bit more stressed than I was before, but managing. I'm glad to hear you're managing. What do you think has contributed to that increased stress? I think work has been a bit more demanding lately. Just a lot of pressure to meet targets. I’ve been feeling more irritable and down, like I mentioned last time.  Honestly, it feels a bit far off right now. With everything going on, it’s hard to stay focused on that."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I think so. I have friends and family, but I just don’t always reach out. I guess I feel like I should handle things on my own. Like it’s a burden to others."

Current Functional Status,"Yeah, I did go a couple of times, but then I fell off again. It’s like I have a hard time sticking to routines. I’ve tried deep breathing exercises, but I don’t always remember to do them when I need them."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That sounds like a solid plan. You could also consider pairing the exercises with something you already do daily, like your morning coffee or before bed. That sounds perfect. We can work on stress management techniques and break down your goals into actionable steps. "
Next Steps,"Yeah, that could work. Maybe I could set a reminder on my phone. That’s a valid concern. However, sharing your feelings might help them understand your behavior better. Would you be open to trying that? Yeah, I think I could try talking to my best friend about it. He usually gets it. Maybe I could start by researching the types of businesses I’m interested in or networking with people in those fields. I’d like to have a clearer plan for managing my stress and maybe talk more about my goals."
