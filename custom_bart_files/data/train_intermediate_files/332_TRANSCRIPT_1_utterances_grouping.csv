History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie. I've been okay, I guess. Just the usual tiredness and feeling down. I appreciate you sharing that. Last time, we talked about some of the challenges you've been facing, especially with your depression and feelings of fatigue. Have you noticed any changes since then? Not really. I still feel pretty unmotivated and just… stuck, you know? I think it’s just the heaviness I feel. Some days, I just don’t want to get out of bed. Yeah, I keep thinking about money and how I’m going to make it through the month. It’s really stressful. I’ve thought about budgeting, but it just feels like too much right now. Well, I have rent, utilities, and food, of course. And I have to get my cigarettes, too. That sounds okay. I just want to feel less anxious about it all. Hmm… I guess I enjoyed a couple of episodes of a show I like. That made me laugh. I used to enjoy crocheting and making jewelry, but I haven’t felt like doing that lately."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I understand. It can feel overwhelming when you're in that state. Have you had a chance to try any of the coping strategies we discussed, like setting small goals for yourself? Financial stress can be a significant burden. It’s understandable that it would affect your sleep and mood. Have you considered any strategies to help manage those financial worries? That’s a common feeling, especially when you’re already feeling overwhelmed. Would it help if we broke it down into smaller steps together? That’s wonderful! Finding those moments of joy, even in small things, is really important. Would you be willing to set a goal to watch something that makes you happy a few times a week? It sounds like you have some creative outlets that you used to enjoy. Would you be open to trying to set aside a little time for those activities again? That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s about starting small. Even spending just a few minutes on something you enjoy can be beneficial. "
Next Steps,"Fantastic! As we wrap up today, let’s set a couple of goals for the week. One could be to watch a couple of episodes of your favorite show, and the other could be to try crocheting for a short time. How does that sound? Sounds good. I think I can manage that."
