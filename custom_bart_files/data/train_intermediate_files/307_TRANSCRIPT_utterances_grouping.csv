History of Present Illness (HPI), uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter] but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess uh yesterday and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money  so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter] but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing 
Medical and Psychiatric History,uh no i don't think so but i mean i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds nope nope
Psychosocial History,um moscow um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um i guess pretty close right now we're kinda distant okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of uh probably my best friend nicole she's probably been we've been best friends for like god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah uh my friend nicole um we met in french class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography just hanging out with friends i guess it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things  i don't really discuss that with them so i guess superficially close but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter] bubbly  fun  maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um  uh definitely friendly um and pretty like a positive person my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in  san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun
