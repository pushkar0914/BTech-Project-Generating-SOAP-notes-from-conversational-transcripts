Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint,"Yeah, I have. I think I'm leaning more towards moving. The opportunities seem better there. I guess I’m just worried about the auditions. I really want to land something soon."
Trauma History,Nothing reported
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"I feel like I need a change. LA is great, but I’m starting to feel a bit stagnant in my career. I want to try for bigger roles, maybe even some theater stuff. I miss performing on stage. It’s definitely a bit intimidating, but I think it’s necessary for my growth. I think I was just in a good mood and ready to meet new people. I usually just try to prepare as much as I can, but it’s still nerve-wracking. I feel good. I’m excited about the changes ahead."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"They’re really supportive. My dad always encourages me to follow my dreams. Definitely. It makes me feel like I have a safety net if things don’t go as planned. I’ll miss them, but I think it’s part of growing up. I need to do this for myself."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I could remind myself that everyone else is probably feeling the same way.  Simple breathing exercises can be effective. For example, taking a few moments to focus on your breath can help calm your nerves before an audition or class. Yeah, I think that could help. Visualizing success sounds good. It feels empowering. I like that idea."
Next Steps,I guess I need to start networking more and maybe take a few classes when I get there. Maybe some acting workshops or improv classes. I think that would help me get back into the groove. That sounds doable. I’ll give it a try. Maybe I can plan more outings or set goals to meet new people. I plan on calling regularly and maybe visiting when I can.
