History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I've been okay, a bit anxious, to be honest.  I remember you mentioned feeling anxious about work and stability. Has anything specific triggered those feelings recently? Yeah, I had a couple of shifts at the call center that were really tough. A lot of pressure from management, and I worry about my performance.  Well, there were a lot of calls, and I felt like I was juggling too many things at once. I ended up making a mistake on one of the calls, and I just felt terrible afterward. I tried to shake it off, but I kept replaying the situation in my head. I felt like I let everyone down. I’ve been looking for more local gigs, but they’re hard to come by.  A bit nervous, but I know it’s necessary. "

Therapeutic Interventions,Maybe I could practice some mindfulness techniques or breathing exercises.  How about we explore a simple technique together? We can start with a breathing exercise. Would you be open to that? Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four… hold it for a moment… and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do that a few times together.
Next Steps,I haven’t really. I guess I could reach out to some people I know in the industry. It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Maybe we can set a small goal for you to reach out to one person this week? That sounds manageable. I can do that.
