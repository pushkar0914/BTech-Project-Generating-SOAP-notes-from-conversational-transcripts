History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, I guess. A bit up and down.  Up and down? Can you elaborate on that?  Well, some days I feel really good, like after I go hiking or fishing. But then there are days when I feel really low and just can’t shake it off.  I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some fluctuations in your mood. Have you noticed any triggers for those low days?  Yeah, sometimes it’s just the pain in my back that makes everything seem worse. Other times, it’s thoughts about my business or my dad.  Those sound like significant stressors. How do you usually cope when those thoughts come up?  I try to distract myself, maybe watch a movie or go for a walk, but it doesn’t always work.  It’s understandable to want to distract yourself. Have you tried any specific coping strategies that have been helpful?  I’ve been meditating more. That helps sometimes, but it’s hard to focus when my mind is racing.  Great! I can suggest some apps or resources you can explore. Now, you mentioned feeling low when thinking about your business. Can you share more about that?  Yeah, I just think about what could have been if I hadn’t sold it. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice.  I could have sought advice or just waited it out. I acted out of fear, and I regret that.  It’s common to look back and wish we had made different choices. How does that regret affect you now?  It makes me feel stuck sometimes, like I can’t move forward.  I think I need to find a way to let go of that regret.  <pauses> I feel regret for selling my business out of fear. I wish I had been more patient and sought help. I learned that fear often leads to hasty decisions. Moving forward, I want to make decisions based on clarity, not fear.  Excellent. Now, let’s shift gears a bit. You mentioned feeling a bit depressed. Can you describe what that looks like for you on a daily basis?  It’s just a heaviness, like I’m dragging my feet. I don’t want to do much, and I feel unmotivated.  That sounds really tough. Have you noticed any activities that help lift that heaviness?  Sometimes being outdoors helps, but it’s not consistent.  Being in nature can be very grounding. What about your relationships? Have you been able to connect with friends or family?  That’s a great step. Remember, it’s okay to lean on your support system. Now, let’s talk about your sleep. You mentioned it’s been difficult. Have you made any changes since we last spoke? "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Let’s take a few moments to write down how you feel about the business sale. You can include your regrets, what you learned, and how you want to move forward.  I’m glad to hear that. Writing can be a therapeutic way to process emotions. Would you consider doing that more regularly?  It’s understandable to want to protect loved ones from our struggles, but sharing can often strengthen those connections. Would you be willing to experiment with being more open with them?  Stretching can be helpful. Another technique is to establish a calming bedtime routine. Have you considered that?  A calming routine can signal to your body that it’s time to wind down. This could include activities like reading, gentle stretching, or even listening to soothing music. "
Next Steps,I’d like to explore more about letting go of regret and maybe some more coping strategies.  That sounds like a solid plan. We can also check in on your sleep and meditation practices.
