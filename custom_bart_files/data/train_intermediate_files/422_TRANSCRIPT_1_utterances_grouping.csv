History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I feel really overwhelmed sometimes. Like, I’m not sure if I’m cut out for this.   I think it's just the amount of work and trying to balance everything else in my life.   I’ve tried making to-do lists, but I still feel like I’m not getting enough done.   Yeah, that might help. I just feel like I have so much to do all at once.   Right, but I struggle with knowing what to prioritize.   It feels a bit better to see it laid out like this.   A little less anxious, honestly.  "
Medical and Psychiatric History,Not really. I’m still trying to figure it out with my doctor.  
Psychosocial History,"Um, I've been okay, I guess. Just trying to keep up with school and everything.   I usually go for a walk or watch a show.   I do have friends, but I don’t always reach out when I need help.   I think I don’t want to burden them with my problems.   Maybe. I just don’t want to seem weak.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"To-do lists can be helpful. Maybe we can explore breaking down your tasks into smaller steps?   How about we try an exercise? We can list out your tasks and categorize them by urgency and importance.   I’m glad to hear that. Now, let’s think about how you can tackle the paper. What are the steps you need to take?   Sounds reasonable. How about we set aside specific times for that?   That’s a solid plan. Would you like to set specific goals for each day?   Perfect! Let’s summarize your timeline: two days for research, one day for outlining, and three days for writing.   Those sound like great ways to relax. How about incorporating those into your study schedule?   It’s understandable to feel that way, but friends often want to help. Would you consider sharing your feelings with them?   Seeking support doesn’t show weakness; it shows strength. It’s okay to lean on others.   Mindfulness or deep breathing can be helpful. Would you like to try a brief exercise?   Let’s take a few deep breaths together. Inhale deeply… and exhale slowly.   I’m glad to hear that. You can use this technique whenever you feel stressed.  "
Next Steps,That sounds like a solid goal. Let’s check in on that next time.
