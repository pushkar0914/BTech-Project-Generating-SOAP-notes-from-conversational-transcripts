History of Present Illness (HPI),well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house  um i was waking up at focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression  slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed   well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with  you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well
Medical and Psychiatric History,i i studied art and photography uh it it wasn't so much a decision i just kept noticing that i was very interested in it  running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business  no i have not yes  oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist  yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was  no eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that  he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days  i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa> i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics i had i was an art major and i had no car so   a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to  
Psychosocial History,from here from eh from alhambra  uh the weather's really nice and everything's very familiar  uh sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads too too much traffic  uh no not no i'm an also an apartment manager it keeps me tied down  um it's uh fair it's not the greatest because of being an apartment manager i've i do have free rent but i have to stay that part does the free rent part is very good  well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school there was a few of the things that i was happy about some art pieces i've made were memorable well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a uh there's a few that are from far <f> distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and   my other brother lives in maui <clears throat>  oh mostly very talented <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up just seems like they were all hooked into social media  not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups> i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site   the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside  and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and  and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job  that's yeah that's how they do things well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we we were arguing where to go first  well i'm i've been told i'm very patient  and also i have um some original original artistic ideas   those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um  you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them  i had a nice experience uh just uh photographing um a soccer game recently   i really enjoyed that so
