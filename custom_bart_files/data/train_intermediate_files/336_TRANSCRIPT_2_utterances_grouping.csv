History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yes! I found an open mic night and performed last weekend. It was nerve-wracking at first, but once I started singing, it felt amazing. They seemed to enjoy it! I got a few compliments afterward, which felt great. It felt validating, like all the hard work was worth it. Yes! I’ve been meditating before bed, and it’s really helping me unwind. I think I’m being kinder to myself. I still have moments, but I’m catching them quicker. It gives me a boost of confidence and reminds me why I love singing. I think we could work on communication a bit more. Sometimes I hold back my feelings. I worry about burdening her with my problems. I’ve been reflecting on it. I still don’t want to be around them, but I’m trying to let go of the anger. It feels freeing, but it’s hard to fully let go."

Psychosocial History,"Hey, Ellie! I’ve been good, a bit busy with work and trying to find gigs. They’re going really well. We’re supportive of each other’s goals. Yes, we talk about our goals a lot. It feels good to have that support. It feels freeing. She encourages me to go after what I want."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been practicing affirmations and reminding myself of my strengths. “I am a talented singer, and I deserve to share my voice.”"
Next Steps,"I’m thinking of looking for more open mics and maybe even some small gigs. I could set a specific number of events to attend each month. Maybe two or three a month? I could say it every morning when I wake up. Maybe I could pick a specific time to talk about my feelings when we’re both relaxed. I could write down my feelings about them and then find a way to release that energy. Yes, I’ll give it a shot."
