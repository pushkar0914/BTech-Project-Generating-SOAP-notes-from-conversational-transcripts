Current Functional Status,"Hi! I’ve been okay. I actually started doing a few minutes of yoga like we talked about. I did! I found a few places that work with kids, and I’m thinking of reaching out to them. I think I can bring a lot of patience and creativity. I used to love planning activities for kids. I’ve been trying to connect with some old friends. Talking to them helps remind me that I’m not alone. It’s been nice. A couple of them even want to meet up soon, which I’m looking forward to."

Next Steps,"Maybe setting a specific time each day for it? Like making it part of my routine. Morning yoga sounds like a wonderful plan! Let’s set that as a goal for the next week. How does that sound? Those are wonderful qualities! It sounds like you have a lot to offer. Would you like to set a goal to reach out to one organization this week? Yes, that sounds doable. I’ll try to do it by the end of the week. Of course! I’m here to help you through this process. Let’s check in next week about your yoga routine and your volunteering outreach. Sound good?"
