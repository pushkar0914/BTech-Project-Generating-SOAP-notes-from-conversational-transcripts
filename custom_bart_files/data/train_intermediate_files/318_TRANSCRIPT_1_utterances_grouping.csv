History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's good to hear. Last time, we talked about your late nights and how they affect your sleep. Have you noticed any changes?   Yeah, I tried going to bed a bit earlier, but it's still tough sometimes. I guess I just get caught up in things.   Mostly just scrolling through my phone or watching shows. It’s hard to resist.   That’s a great start. You mentioned you feel sluggish when you don’t sleep well. How has that affected your daily life?   I find it hard to focus at work. I feel like I’m in a fog.   Yeah, anything that requires a lot of concentration. I find myself zoning out.   Not really. I just power through it, but I end up feeling more drained.   I’ve been going out more, but sometimes it drains me.   I usually just need some alone time afterward.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,What if we explored some mindfulness techniques to help you stay present?   That’s a good attitude. Mindfulness can help ground you and improve focus. Would you like to learn a simple breathing exercise?  
Next Steps,"Maybe I could do it during my breaks at work.   I could schedule it in after events, like a little wind-down period.   I think tracking my phone time and practicing mindfulness will really help.   Those sound like excellent goals. Let’s check in on them next time.  "
