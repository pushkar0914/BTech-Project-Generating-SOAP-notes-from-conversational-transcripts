History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's understandable. You mentioned wanting to work on your weight. How has that been going for you? I've started going to the gym more regularly, so I feel like I'm making progress. I feel good, but sometimes I struggle to stay motivated. I guess I get tired of the routine sometimes. I want to see results faster. I want to lose about 15 pounds, but I also want to build muscle. They could definitely be better. I tend to snack a lot when I'm working. Sometimes I try to keep healthy snacks around, but I still end up reaching for junk food. Stress, I think. When I’m stressed, I just want to eat something comforting."
