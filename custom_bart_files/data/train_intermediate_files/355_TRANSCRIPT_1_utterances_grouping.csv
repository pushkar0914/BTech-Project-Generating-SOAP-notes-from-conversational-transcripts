History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time, we talked about your feelings of hopelessness and how you cope by biking. Have you been able to keep up with that? Yeah, I’ve been trying to ride my bike regularly. It helps clear my mind a bit. That’s great! Physical activity can be very beneficial for mental health. Have you noticed any changes in your mood during or after your rides? Sometimes, yes. I feel a bit lighter, but it doesn’t last long.  It’s normal for those feelings to fluctuate. You mentioned feeling depressed about not having a job. Have there been any new developments in that area? Not really. I still haven’t found anything. I’ve been applying, but it’s tough at my age. I understand. Job searching can be a challenging process. How do you feel when you apply for jobs? Frustrated mostly. I feel like I’m just wasting my time sometimes. That’s understandable. It can be disheartening. Have you considered any strategies to make the process feel less overwhelming? A bit nervous, honestly. I haven’t spoken to them in years. Exactly! You don’t have to put too much pressure on yourself. Let’s shift gears a bit. You mentioned feeling like the black sheep of your family. How has that affected you lately? It still bothers me. I wish things were different, but I feel like I can’t change it. It can be tough to navigate family dynamics. Have you thought about what a healthier relationship with your family might look like? I guess I’d want more understanding and support from them. I’d like to talk about my job situation and how it’s affecting me. Wonderful! Let’s talk about your self-esteem. You mentioned feeling proud of your degree. Are there other accomplishments you’d like to acknowledge? I guess I’ve always been good at learning new things, even if I haven’t been motivated. That’s an important skill! Acknowledging your strengths can help build your self-esteem. How do you feel about that realization? It makes me feel a bit better, actually."

Therapeutic Interventions,It’s completely normal to feel anxious. Perhaps you could write down your thoughts beforehand to help you articulate them better.
Next Steps,"I guess I could set small goals for myself, like applying to a few jobs a week. That sounds like a solid plan. Setting achievable goals can help reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed. Is there anything else you might want to try? Maybe I could reach out to some old colleagues for networking.  That’s a great idea! Networking can often lead to opportunities. How do you feel about reconnecting with them? It’s completely normal to feel that way. Perhaps you could start with a simple message. What do you think? Yeah, I could do that. Just keep it casual. That’s a valid desire. What steps do you think you could take to foster that understanding? Maybe I could try to communicate more openly with them. That sounds like a good approach. Open communication can pave the way for better relationships. Are there specific topics you’d like to discuss with them? That’s a great start. Expressing your feelings can help them understand your perspective better. How do you feel about initiating that conversation? That could help. I might try that. That’s great to hear! Building on your strengths can be empowering. As we wrap up today, what goals would you like to set for our next session? I’d like to work on reaching out to my old colleagues and maybe drafting a message to my family. Those sound like excellent goals. I believe in your ability to take those steps. We can discuss how that went in our next session."
