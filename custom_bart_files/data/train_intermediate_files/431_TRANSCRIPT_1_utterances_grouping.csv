History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay, just adjusting to life here a bit more. I’ve been exploring more areas, and it’s been nice. I still love the weather! A few, yes. I went to a local event and met some friendly folks. It felt good to connect with others. I was a bit shy at first, but it got easier. I try to remind myself that everyone is just as nervous sometimes. Sometimes it’s just feeling overwhelmed with everything happening around me. I’ve been thinking about my relationship with my mom again. I still struggle with the decision to distance myself from her. I wonder if it was the right choice. I feel guilty sometimes. I see other families being close, and I wonder if I missed out. I needed to protect myself from negativity."

Current Functional Status,"Um, I see the chair, the wall, a plant, the window, and a picture. The chair, my arms, my phone, and my hair. I can hear the clock ticking, some traffic outside, and my own breathing. I can smell my lotion and the coffee from earlier. I still taste the coffee."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been listening to more music, especially when I feel anxious. Mostly instrumental or soft melodies. It helps me unwind. I try to take deep breaths and remind myself it’s okay to take a break. Great! One technique is grounding exercises. They can help bring you back to the present moment. Would you like to try one?"
