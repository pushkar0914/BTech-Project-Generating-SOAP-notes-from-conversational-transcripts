History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I didn’t think I’d be interested in applying for jobs outside of journalism, but some other fields caught my attention.   Well, I thought about public relations and even some marketing roles. They seem like they could use my skills too.   I feel excited but also a bit scared. It’s like stepping into the unknown.   I try to remind myself that it’s okay to be scared. I also talk to friends for support.   I just explained my goals and reassured her that I’d keep her in the loop about my decisions.   Yeah, I think I need to work on it with my friends too. Sometimes I hesitate to speak up.   I guess I worry about hurting their feelings or causing conflict.   I’ve thought about journaling, but I haven’t really committed to it.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"Journaling can be a powerful tool for processing emotions. Would you be open to starting a simple journaling practice?   Yeah, I think I could try that. Just writing down my thoughts and feelings might help.   I’ll give it a shot. I think it could help me clarify my feelings.  "
Next Steps,I think I’ll definitely reach out more. It helps to talk things through.   I like that approach. I’ll try to keep it in mind next time.   Great!
