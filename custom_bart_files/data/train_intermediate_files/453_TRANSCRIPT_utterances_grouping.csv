History of Present Illness (HPI),uh three days ago it was about communication it was uh the lack of communication on the other person's part i needed them to communicate better so that way i could understand uh they didn't communicate so we had an argument um probably the lack of time spent with my grandparents growing up it's just when they're gone you regret that you didn't miss time with spent time with them i had partied 'til like four in the morning and then i had did my event at like ten o'clock in the morning i was my xxx captain and i embarrassed my whole team that's one thing i truly regret yeah <sigh> like not party thought about other people besides myself uh due to my own injuries um i had just gone through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and i decided to do that i wanted to help people too uh dreams the dreams become too real my years of fighting it just uh it caught up to me uh anxiety <anxi> anxious <sigh> uh um a lot of anxieties uh but it's good i have techniques to bring myself down now have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d insomnia issues well i had i noticed is i still deal with pictures and emotions but what i do is now i've i really practice hard at taking care of myself and and getting to those places the things that strike me that get get me anxious or excited or angry and this has really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real um <sigh> in my dreams when i dream i do i was just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight and that was another thing too i build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then i always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always mm what gets me scared in all my dreams is that i should've made the move and finished the fight and i didn't and so it builds anxiety and stress in me and then i tend to act out in my sleep just not spending time with my grandparents and and
