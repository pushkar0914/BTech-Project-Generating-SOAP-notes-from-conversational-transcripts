History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s understandable. Last time, we talked about some of the challenges you’ve faced, especially regarding your past experiences and how they affect you now. Have you noticed any changes or feelings since then? That makes sense. Revisiting those feelings can be tough. How did you cope with those feelings when they came up? I tried to distract myself with other assignments, but it was hard to focus. I kept thinking about the past and how it felt to go through that situation again."

Therapeutic Interventions,"It sounds like avoidance is a common strategy for you. While it can work temporarily, it might not be the best long-term solution. Have you considered any mindfulness techniques to help ground yourself during those moments? I’ve heard of mindfulness, but I haven’t really tried it. I’m not sure how to start. Mindfulness can be as simple as focusing on your breath or being present in the moment. Would you be open to trying a brief mindfulness exercise together now? Sure, I can give it a shot. Great! Let’s take a moment to close our eyes, if you’re comfortable. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together. Okay, I’m doing it."
Next Steps,"That’s wonderful to hear! Incorporating moments like this into your routine could really help. Do you think you could try this technique when you feel anxious or overwhelmed? I’ll definitely try. I think it could help me manage my stress better. That’s a great step forward. Let’s talk about your goals for the upcoming week. What would you like to focus on until our next session? I’d like to work on being more present, especially when I’m feeling anxious about work. Maybe practicing mindfulness daily could help. That sounds like a solid goal! You might also consider journaling about your experiences. Writing down your thoughts can help you process them better. What do you think? I like that idea. I’ve always found writing to be therapeutic. It’s understandable to want to protect her, but sharing your feelings might strengthen your bond. You could offer support without overwhelming her. How does that sound? That makes sense. I’ll try to have an open conversation with her."
