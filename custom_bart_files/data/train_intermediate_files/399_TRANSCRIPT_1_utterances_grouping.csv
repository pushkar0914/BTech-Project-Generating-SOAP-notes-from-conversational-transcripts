History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, I guess. A mix of ups and downs, like I mentioned last time. Yeah, actually. I had a really good day with friends, but then I also had a rough day where I felt really low. Um, I just felt really unmotivated. I didn't want to do anything, and I ended up just sitting around all day. I think it was just a lot of pressure from school and feeling like I'm not doing enough. I try to write or play music, but sometimes I just end up shutting down. Not really. I just kind of let it pass. Mostly in school. I feel like I should be getting better grades or doing more extracurricular activities. Maybe just being kinder to myself when I feel low instead of pushing myself to be okay."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I guess I just want to prove to myself and my family that I can succeed. They’re pretty good. They understand me, and I can talk to them about stuff. Not really. I tend to keep that stuff to myself."

Next Steps,"I think I could try that. Maybe just focusing on one assignment at a time instead of trying to do everything at once. I could aim to finish my essay by the end of the week instead of stressing about all my assignments. I could tell my friends about it, so they can check in on me. I think I could try. It might help to talk about it. I could remind myself that it’s okay to have bad days and that I don’t have to be perfect."
