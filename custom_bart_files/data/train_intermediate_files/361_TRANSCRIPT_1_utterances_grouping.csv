History of Present Illness (HPI),"Actually, yes! I just got back from a short trip to San Francisco for a weekend getaway. It was nice to explore a new city. I felt really happy and relaxed. It was nice to take a break from my routine. I even took some time to just sit by the water and reflect. I found myself thinking about my career and where I want to be in the next few years. I guess I’m feeling a bit uncertain about my future. Well, I love my job in IT, but I sometimes wonder if I should pursue something more creative, like working in tech design or development. I’ve always enjoyed being creative, whether it's through photography or video games. I think it would be fulfilling to combine that with my technical skills. I’ve considered taking some design courses or even working on personal projects to build my portfolio. But I’m a bit hesitant to take that leap."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One approach could be reframing your thoughts around failure. Instead of seeing it as a negative outcome, consider it a learning opportunity. How does that resonate with you? I like that idea. I guess I’ve always seen failure as something to avoid, but it does make sense that it can be a part of growth. Absolutely! Another strategy could be setting small, achievable goals related to your creative interests. This way, you can build confidence gradually. What do you think about that?"
Next Steps,That sounds manageable. I could start with a small photography project or a design challenge. Sure! I think I’ll aim to complete a photography project by next time. Maybe something themed around my recent trip?
