History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, actually! I wrote a couple of articles that got published, which felt really rewarding.   It felt amazing, honestly. It was like all the hard work paid off.   Yeah, I think I’ve become more confident. I used to doubt myself a lot, but now I feel like I can actually contribute.   I think just getting positive feedback from my editors and seeing my articles in print really boosted my self-esteem.   We ended up talking it out. I tried to explain my perspective, and she listened, but I think she’s still worried.   I feel like I’m making progress, but there are times I doubt myself, especially with big decisions ahead.   Just figuring out where to apply for jobs and what kind of life I want after graduation.   I think that covers most of it. I just want to keep working on being more assertive with my feelings.  "

Psychosocial History,"Well, it just makes me feel like I'm on the right path, you know? Like I’m doing something meaningful.   Well, I had a bit of a disagreement with my mom. It was about something small, but it escalated.   It was about my plans after graduation. She wants me to stay close to home, but I want to explore opportunities elsewhere.   Yeah, I think so. I just want her to understand I’m trying to grow.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I took a step back and reminded myself to breathe. I also talked to a couple of my coworkers for advice, which helped a lot.   Yeah, I think I could use that approach when I’m feeling anxious about family stuff or personal relationships.   Maybe I could share my plans more clearly and reassure her that I’ll still stay connected, no matter where I go.   I haven’t, but that sounds like a good idea. It could help me clarify my thoughts.   I think I need to practice it more, especially with my family and friends.  "
