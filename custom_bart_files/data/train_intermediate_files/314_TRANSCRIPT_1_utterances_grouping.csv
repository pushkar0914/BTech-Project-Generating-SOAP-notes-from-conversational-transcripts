History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yes, we had a family meeting. Everyone is on board, but there are still so many logistics to figure out.   Just the thought of uprooting my family and the renovations. I want to make it a comfortable space for everyone.   I’ve tried to focus on one task at a time, but sometimes it feels like too much.   Not really. I feel guilty taking time when there's so much to do.   Maybe if I scheduled it like an appointment? But I worry about being seen as selfish.   A bit freeing, actually. It’s nice to know I can carve out that space.   She’s doing better, but there are still tough days. The group therapy helped, but it’s a process.   Yes, we’ve had some heart-to-heart talks. I try to be open, but sometimes she shuts down.   I think she feels overwhelmed and doesn’t want to burden me.   I tell her that I’m here for her and that it’s okay to feel whatever she’s feeling.   I think I’m more aware of it, but I still have moments where it creeps back in, especially with the stress of everything.   I try deep breathing exercises and sometimes I journal.   I tend to forget about them until I’m really stressed.   I’ve been thinking about how to support my daughter better. I want to be there for her but also not overwhelm her.   I feel more hopeful. It’s nice to talk through these things and feel supported.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,That’s normal. How about we work on integrating those techniques into your daily routine?   That’s a solid goal. We can dive deeper into coping strategies and maybe explore some mindfulness techniques if you’re open to it.  
Next Steps,Exactly! How about we set a goal for you to schedule at least one hour a week just for yourself?   That sounds doable. I can start with that.   I enjoy reading and sometimes just sitting outside with a cup of tea.   That could help. Maybe setting reminders on my phone?   I haven’t directly asked her that. It might be a good idea to check in with her.   Excellent! Let’s set that as a focus for our next session.
