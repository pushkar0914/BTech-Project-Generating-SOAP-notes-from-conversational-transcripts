History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie. I’ve been okay. I reached out to that producer I mentioned last time. Nervous at first, but once we started talking, it felt natural. He gave me some good advice on getting started. A bit intimidated, but I think I can manage it. I just need to remember that it’s part of the process. I had a bit of a setback with my anxiety. I had a panic attack last week out of nowhere. I think it was a combination of stress from work and worrying about my family’s expectations."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Yes, actually. I’ve been trying to stay calm and not let their doubts get to me. I tried to use the breathing techniques we practiced, but it was hard to focus. One technique is the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise. It involves identifying five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Would you like to try it together?"
Next Steps,"I was thinking of reaching out to some local artists and see if they’d be interested in collaborating. Yes, please. I could use more tools for when that happens. I think I just want to keep building on my goals and maybe talk about how to handle setbacks."
