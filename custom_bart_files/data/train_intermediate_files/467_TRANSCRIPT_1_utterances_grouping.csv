History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s understandable. Last time, you mentioned feeling unsure about your direction in life. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke?   Yeah, a bit. I've been thinking about what I really want to do, but I'm still not sure.   It’s a big question. What kind of things have you been considering?   Well, I keep coming back to that idea of working outdoors, like being a forest ranger or something.   A little. I’ve seen some volunteer programs, but I haven’t applied to anything yet.   I guess I’m just nervous about committing to something. What if I don’t like it?   I think I’m also worried about making friends here in L.A.   I’ve met a few people through classes, but it’s hard to connect deeply.   I’m just naturally shy, I guess. It takes me a while to open up.   I’ve seen some art classes and music meetups, but I haven’t gone to any yet.   Just the thought of being in a new group makes me anxious.   I usually just try to distract myself with music or drawing.  "

Next Steps,"Maybe I could do some short-term volunteering first?   That’s understandable. How about setting a small goal, like attending just one class?   I think I could do that. Just one class to start.   That’s wonderful! You can use this technique anytime you’re feeling anxious.   Alright, let’s set a goal for next time. How about you try that art class and practice the mindfulness exercise?   Sounds good! I’ll try to do both.  "
