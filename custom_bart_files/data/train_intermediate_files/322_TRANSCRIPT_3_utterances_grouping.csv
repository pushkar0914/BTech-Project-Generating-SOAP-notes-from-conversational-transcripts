History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! Things have been going well. I successfully delivered my presentation last week! It went better than I expected. I was nervous, but I used the breathing techniques, and it really helped. I felt a huge sense of relief and accomplishment. It was nice to receive positive feedback from my colleagues too. Definitely! I feel more confident in my abilities to handle similar situations in the future. I’ve been feeling a bit unfulfilled lately, and I want to make sure I’m doing something that truly excites me. I’ve always been interested in teaching or mentoring, but I’m not sure how to transition into that."

Psychosocial History,"We went to a movie together last weekend, and we had a great time again. They really seem to enjoy spending time with me. It makes me really happy. I love seeing them smile and having fun together. I want to take them to a science museum next. I think they would love it! We’ve had a few more conversations, and while we still disagree, I think we’re understanding each other better. I’ve been trying to ask more questions and really listen to his point of view. A little bit. We both care about our parents, and I think that’s a good starting point."

Next Steps,"Teaching can be a very rewarding path. Perhaps we can explore ways to gain experience in that area. Would you be open to setting a goal to research opportunities or volunteer in teaching? Yes, I’d like that! I’ll look into local programs or workshops. I want to focus on exploring teaching opportunities and continue nurturing my relationships with my family."
