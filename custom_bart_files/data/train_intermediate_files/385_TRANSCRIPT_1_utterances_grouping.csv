History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yeah, I guess. It’s just the same every day. Hmm, maybe when I was supposed to go out with friends last week. I just didn’t want to. They’re okay, but sometimes I just want to be alone. Not really. I think I spend too much time alone. I don’t know. I guess I felt frustrated when I saw someone driving recklessly."

Next Steps,"One approach could be to set small, manageable goals for socializing. For instance, committing to just one outing a month. How does that sound? That could work.  Maybe basketball with friends? That sounds like a great idea! Basketball is something you enjoy, and it can be a good way to connect with friends. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to them? I think so.  Excellent! Let’s set a goal for you to reach out to them this week. How does that feel? I can do that. Maybe by being more careful when I drive? Perfect! As we wrap up today, let’s recap what you’ll focus on until our next session. You’ll reach out to your friends about basketball and practice mindful driving. How does that sound?"
