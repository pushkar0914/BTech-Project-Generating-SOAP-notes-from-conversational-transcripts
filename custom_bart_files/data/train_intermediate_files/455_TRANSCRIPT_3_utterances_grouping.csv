History of Present Illness (HPI),"Definitely! I felt less lonely, and it made me appreciate my friendships more. Yes, I have! I feel more confident in expressing my needs, and it’s been liberating. There was a moment when a friend pushed for details about my personal life, but I reminded myself to stay firm. I told them I wasn’t comfortable sharing certain things, and they respected that. It felt good to assert myself. I feel more balanced. I’m not as easily overwhelmed by social situations. It’s been wonderful! Everyone is friendly, and I feel like I belong. I feel energized and happy. It’s refreshing to be around like-minded people. I think I want to explore my feelings of loneliness further. I’ve noticed it still creeps in sometimes. Usually when I’m at home alone after a busy day. It’s like a stark contrast."

Psychosocial History,"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been good. I reached out to a couple of friends, and it felt great! They were really fulfilling. I felt more connected, and it reminded me of the importance of friendship. I joined a local hiking group! It’s a great way to meet people while enjoying nature."
