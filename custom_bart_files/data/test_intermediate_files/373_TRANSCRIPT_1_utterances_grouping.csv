History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie! I've been okay, just keeping busy with work and trying to manage my anxiety. Yeah, I actually landed a new project that I’m really excited about. It’s a documentary about local artists in L.A. Honestly, it felt like a huge relief. I was so anxious about not having anything lined up. When I got the call, it felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders. I think it helps a lot. Just having something to focus on takes my mind off the worry of what’s next. But I still have those moments of doubt, you know? I’ve tried reminding myself of past successes, like the last documentary I did. But sometimes it feels like it’s not enough to quiet that voice. Great! What’s a specific negative thought you’ve had recently about this new project? Let’s challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that supports this fear? Well, I guess I don’t have any concrete evidence. I’ve always received positive feedback in the past. I’ve had successful projects before, and I’ve built good relationships with artists. They’ve always appreciated my work. It definitely softens it. I feel more confident knowing I have a track record of success. Just that I’ve been feeling a bit more anxious at night, especially when I’m trying to sleep. I think it’s when I start thinking about work and what I need to do the next day. My mind just races."

Therapeutic Interventions,"It’s a good start to remind yourself of your accomplishments. Would you be open to trying some cognitive-behavioral techniques to challenge those negative thoughts? One technique is to identify a specific negative thought and then challenge it with evidence. For example, if you think, “I won’t be able to deliver quality work,” you could ask yourself, “What evidence do I have that supports this thought?” That makes sense. I could list out the positive feedback I’ve received in the past.  Perfect! You can apply that same kindness to yourself. Would you like to practice this technique together? I’ve been thinking, “What if the artists don’t like what I create?” Excellent! Now, what evidence contradicts that thought? That’s wonderful! By practicing this technique regularly, it can help reduce the power of those negative thoughts. How do you feel about incorporating this into your routine? That’s very common. Would you be interested in exploring some relaxation techniques to help you wind down at night? One technique is mindfulness meditation. It can help you focus on the present moment and quiet your mind. Would you like to try a brief exercise now? Okay, let’s take a moment to focus on your breath. Breathe in deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth.  Great. As you breathe, I want you to visualize any tension leaving your body with each exhale.  Wonderful! You could try this technique at night before bed. It may help ease your mind and prepare you for sleep."
Next Steps,I think it could be really helpful. I’ll try to remember to challenge myself when those thoughts come up. That’s a great plan. How about we check in on your progress with this technique in our next session?
