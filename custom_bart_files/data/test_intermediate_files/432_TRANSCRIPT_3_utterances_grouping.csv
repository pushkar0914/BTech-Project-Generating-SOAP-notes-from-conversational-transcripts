History of Present Illness (HPI),"It felt great! I was able to get a lot done, and I even experimented with some new techniques. I was pleasantly surprised! Some of the shots turned out better than I expected. Yes, I shared some photos with my friend who’s an artist, and she gave me some positive feedback. It felt validating. I’m starting to feel more confident about my work. I’m thinking of capturing different aspects of my life here, like the people I meet and the places I visit. Yes! I’ve been jotting down ideas and locations that resonate with me. I feel excited and a little nervous. It’s a bit vulnerable to share my personal story. I guess I’ll remind myself that everyone has their own story, and mine is just as valid. I have, and it stung at first. I took it personally, but I’ve learned to separate myself from the work. Thank you! I feel like I’m making progress."

Next Steps,I think I want to keep challenging myself with new projects and techniques. I want to create a series that tells a story about my transition to LA. I’ll try to remind myself to consider the feedback objectively and see if there’s something I can learn from it.
