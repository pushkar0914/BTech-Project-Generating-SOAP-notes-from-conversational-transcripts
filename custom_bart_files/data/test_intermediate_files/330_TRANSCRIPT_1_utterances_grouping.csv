History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, mostly just busy with school. That’s understandable. You mentioned last time that you were feeling a bit overwhelmed. Have those feelings changed at all? Um, I think they’ve been a little better, but I still feel some pressure. Yeah, sometimes it’s just the amount of work I have. I feel like I’m juggling too much. I’ve tried that a bit, but it’s hard to stay motivated sometimes. That’s wonderful to hear. Now, you mentioned feeling down at times. Have you noticed any patterns with those feelings? Sometimes it happens when I feel like I’m not making progress. I completed a tough math course last semester, and I did well. I think I should do that more often. I tend to keep things to myself."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Those are great coping strategies! Have you noticed any specific situations or tasks that trigger those feelings of pressure? Sure, I can write it down and remind myself of it."
Next Steps,"Maybe setting smaller goals or rewards for myself would help. Maybe treating myself to a nice meal or a new book after I finish a project. Those sound like nice rewards! Let’s set a goal for the next week. How about picking one task to break down and reward yourself after completing it? Okay, I can do that. I have a project due next week that I can work on. I think I can start by outlining what I need to do. That’s an excellent achievement! Celebrating those successes can help shift your mindset. Would you like to incorporate that into your next week’s goals? I think I could tell my mentor about it. Not in the last week. I should reach out. I’d like to talk about my goals and maybe get some advice on managing my workload. I can send them a message and see if they’re free to chat."
