History of Present Illness (HPI),um initially it was easy because i felt like what life is out here it became more difficult than originally i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago there's been like some tension going on i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday i don't know i kind of just feel very like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california
Medical and Psychiatric History,um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and so i decided to pursue art um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and i guess just my childhood in general after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically like so so no no i have been diagnosed with anxiety no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went
Psychosocial History,i'm from greenwich connecticut um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there it's less superficial <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just uh fine arts and photography um well my family's very close my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and um she was she was a very positive influence and always the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or as a great charismatic funny outgoing i'm a very good judge of character
