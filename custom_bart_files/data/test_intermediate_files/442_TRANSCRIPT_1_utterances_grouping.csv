History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. Last time, we talked about your feelings of anxiety and how you’ve been managing your depression. Have you noticed any changes in your emotions or thoughts recently? Well, I’ve been feeling a bit more anxious lately, especially with work. I feel like there’s so much to do, and I’m not making enough progress. That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what’s been contributing to that anxiety? I think it’s just the pressure to succeed. I feel like I’m falling behind, and I have this constant nagging feeling that I'm not doing enough. I’ve tried meditating a bit more, but it’s hard to stay focused. My mind tends to wander. Good. Now, what are four things you can feel? I feel the chair against my back, my feet on the floor, my hands resting on my lap, and the air on my skin. I’m glad to hear that. Grounding techniques can be really helpful when anxiety strikes. Have you noticed any specific triggers for your anxiety lately? Mostly work-related deadlines. I feel like I’m always racing against the clock. Not really. I usually just look at the big picture and get overwhelmed. It makes me feel a bit more in control, I think. That’s a positive shift! Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. Now, let’s revisit your relationship with your family. You mentioned it was sketchy. How have you been feeling about that? That’s a great start! It can help you feel more connected. Now, let's talk about your past relationships. You mentioned your breakup a few weeks ago. How have you been coping with that? It’s been hard. I miss the companionship, but I know it was for the best. It sounds like you’re processing your feelings well. Have you had moments of reflection on what you want in future relationships?"

Therapeutic Interventions,"It’s common to feel overwhelmed when there’s a lot on your plate. Have you been able to implement any coping strategies we discussed last time? That’s completely normal. Meditation takes practice. Would you like to explore some additional techniques that might help with your focus? Great! One technique is called grounding. It helps you reconnect with the present moment. Would you like to try a brief grounding exercise now? Perfect. Take a deep breath in... and let it out slowly. Now, I want you to focus on your five senses. What are five things you can see around you? Excellent. Now, three things you can hear? I can hear your voice, the sound of traffic outside, and my own breathing. Wonderful! Now, two things you can smell? And finally, one thing you can taste? How do you feel after that exercise? That’s understandable. It can be helpful to break tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Have you tried setting smaller goals for yourself? That’s understandable. Maintaining connections can be tough, especially from a distance. Would you like to explore ways to strengthen those connections?"
Next Steps,"That’s a common challenge. Let’s try to set a small goal for the week. What’s one task you can break down into smaller steps? I have a project that’s due next week. I could break it down into sections. That sounds like a great plan. What’s the first step you can take today? One idea is to schedule regular video calls or even send them updates about your life. Would that be something you’d consider? That’s a valuable insight. Knowing what you want can guide you in future relationships. Have you thought about what you might do to meet new people? I haven’t really put much thought into it. I guess I could try some social events or clubs. I enjoy music and art. Maybe I could check out some local events. That sounds promising! Engaging in your interests can create opportunities for connection. As we wrap up today’s session, what’s one takeaway you’d like to focus on until we meet again? I think I’ll focus on breaking down my project into smaller tasks and reaching out to my family more. That’s a solid plan. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember to be kind to yourself in the process. "
