History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been a mix. I talked to my wife like we discussed, and it went really well. I told her how I’ve been feeling about my health journey and how I sometimes feel stressed. She was really understanding. That’s a significant step forward! Have you noticed any changes in how you approach stress since then? Yeah, I feel like I can talk to her more openly now. It’s less of a burden, I guess. Well, I did have a few stressful days at work, and I found myself slipping back into some old habits. I think it was just being overwhelmed with deadlines. I didn’t want to think about cooking. I felt guilty, like I was letting myself down. Maybe I can see it as a learning experience instead of a failure?"

Therapeutic Interventions,"How about we try another mindfulness exercise? This time, we can focus on grounding techniques.  Excellent! Focusing on your senses can help bring you back to the present moment. You can use this technique whenever you feel overwhelmed. "
Next Steps,I could plan easier meals for those busy days or even involve my kids in cooking.
