History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been doing well. I reached out to my friends like we talked about, and we had a great time! It felt really good. We went out for dinner and just caught up. I realized how important those connections are for me. Definitely! I felt more energized and motivated afterward. It was a nice break from work. Yes, I’ve been trying it in the mornings. It’s been helpful, especially on days when I feel anxious. I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with some upcoming deadlines at work. I want to make sure I’m producing quality work. I completed a short film project recently that I was really proud of. It received positive feedback from my peers. I have three main projects due in the next few weeks. I think I’m good for now. I feel more focused after this conversation."
