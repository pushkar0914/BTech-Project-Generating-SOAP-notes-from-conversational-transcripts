History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay. I tried the bedtime routine, and it helped a bit. Yes, I felt a bit more energized, which was nice. Yes, I went to another small get-together, and I tried to engage more. I felt a little less anxious this time. I still get nervous when I think about meeting new people. It makes me want to avoid those situations altogether. It’s been challenging. I still find myself getting frustrated, especially with my dad. Last week, he kept asking me the same questions about my work, and I felt like he wasn’t listening to me. I snapped at him a bit, which I regretted afterward. Overall, I feel more positive, but I still have moments of self-doubt, especially about my job. "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I think practicing the breathing exercises helped. I also reminded myself that it’s okay not to be perfect. That’s common. We can work on exposure techniques, which involve gradually facing those situations in a controlled way. Would you be open to that? Maybe I could take a deep breath before reacting or remind myself that he’s just trying to connect with me."
Next Steps,Great! We can start small. Perhaps you could aim to meet one new person at your next gathering. How does that sound? Those are great strategies! Practicing that pause can give you a moment to choose how to respond. Would you like to set a goal to try that in the coming week? That’s a common feeling. Would you like to explore those doubts further in our next session?
