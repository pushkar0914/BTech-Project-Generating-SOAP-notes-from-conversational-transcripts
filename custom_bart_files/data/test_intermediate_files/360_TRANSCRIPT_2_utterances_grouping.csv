History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been alright, still job searching, but I did manage to see my family over the weekend.   I felt a lot happier afterward. It reminded me of the good times we share.   It feels good to have a routine, even if I haven’t heard back from many places yet.   I felt a bit down, but I reminded myself it’s part of the process.   A little, but I think spending time with family helped.   Sometimes it’s just feeling stuck in my job search, or when I think about financial issues.   I feel like I’m not as quick to get upset, which is nice.  "
