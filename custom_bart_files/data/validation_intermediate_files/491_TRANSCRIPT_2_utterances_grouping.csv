Therapeutic Interventions,"One technique is to practice visualization. Before your exam, imagine yourself in a calm state, recalling everything you studied. Would you like to try that together? Okay, close your eyes for a moment. Picture yourself sitting at your exam desk, feeling calm and confident. Imagine the questions coming to you easily."
Next Steps,"I’m glad! You can use this visualization technique before your exams to help ease your anxiety. How do you feel about incorporating this into your study routine? I’ll definitely try it. It seems like a good way to boost my confidence. That’s a great goal! Remember to celebrate the small victories, like reconnecting with your sister and practicing mindfulness.  I’d like to continue focusing on my anxiety and maybe talk more about my family dynamics."
