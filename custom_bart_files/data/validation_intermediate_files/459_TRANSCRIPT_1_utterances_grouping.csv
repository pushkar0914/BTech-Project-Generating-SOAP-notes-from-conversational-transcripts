History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’m glad to hear that. Last time we spoke about your relationship with your family and some challenges you face with anger. Have there been any new developments there? Yeah, I had another argument with my mom last week. It was about something small, but it escalated quickly. We were just discussing chores, and I felt like she was being unfair. I ended up raising my voice again, and I felt bad afterward. I tried meditating a couple of times, but I find it hard to focus when I’m upset. Absolutely. It can be helpful to explore your options. You mentioned last time that you struggle with sleep. Have there been any changes there? I’ve tried, but she brushes it off. I feel helpless."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I think it could be really rewarding to help others, especially since I’ve been through a lot myself. I feel like I could relate to people. I guess I’m just worried about my mom’s health. She’s been stressed with work and hasn’t been eating well."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I took a walk with my dog to calm down. It helped a little. That’s a good strategy. Walking can be a great way to release tension. Have you thought about any other coping mechanisms we discussed last time, like meditation? That’s understandable. Sometimes it takes practice to find the right moment to meditate. Would it be helpful to set aside a specific time each day for it, even when you’re feeling okay? That’s a good start. Sometimes, creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help signal to your body that it’s time to sleep. Would you be open to trying some relaxation exercises before bed? Yeah, I could try that. Maybe some light stretching or breathing exercises. It’s tough when we want to help someone who isn’t ready to accept it. Maybe you could suggest doing something together, like cooking a healthy meal?"
Next Steps,"Yeah, I could try that. Maybe in the mornings before my day starts? That’s a great motivation. It sounds like you have a lot of empathy. Have you considered taking any introductory courses to see if it’s something you’d enjoy? I haven’t yet, but I think I might look into it. It’d be nice to have a direction. Great idea! Let’s focus on that for this week. How about we check in on your progress next time? That could work. I’ll give it a shot. Of course! I’m glad we could talk today. Let’s set a goal for your meditation and sleep routine for next week, and we can discuss how it went."
