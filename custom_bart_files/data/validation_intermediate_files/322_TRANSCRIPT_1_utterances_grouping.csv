History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear! Last time, we talked about your experiences with depression and how yoga and meditation have helped you. How have those practices been working for you lately? They've been really helpful. I feel more centered and less anxious. I try to meditate every morning now. It’s wonderful that you’re experiencing those benefits. You mentioned some struggles—can you share more about those days when you find it hard? Well, some days I just feel overwhelmed with work. I sometimes find it hard to concentrate, and I get a bit anxious about deadlines. I try to take breaks and go for walks, but sometimes I just end up procrastinating instead. That’s a positive mindset! Let’s also touch on your family. You mentioned some disagreements with your brother regarding your parents. Have there been any developments in that area since we last spoke? Not really. We still have different opinions, but I’ve tried to be more understanding of his perspective. It makes me feel calmer. I realize that he’s coming from a different place, and it helps me not take things personally. I think my relationship with my niece and nephew could be better. I want to connect with them more."

Next Steps,"I’ve been thinking about making a schedule for my tasks, but I haven’t really implemented it yet. Creating a schedule can be a helpful way to manage your workload. Would you like to set a goal for this week to try that out? Yes, that sounds like a good idea. I’ll try to outline my tasks and set specific times for each. Maybe I could spend more time with them or take them out for activities they enjoy. That sounds like a wonderful plan! Connecting through shared experiences can be very impactful. Would you like to set a goal to do something special with them in the coming weeks? Yes! I’ll plan a day out with them soon."
