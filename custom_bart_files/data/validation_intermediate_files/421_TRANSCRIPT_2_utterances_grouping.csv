History of Present Illness (HPI),"I think I just got too tired and ended up falling asleep on the couch instead. I did feel calmer, but some days it was hard to focus. I think I’ve been a bit less irritable, but I still have my moments. I still feel angry, but I’m trying to remind myself that I can’t control his actions. I’ve tried talking to my friends about it, but I still bottle up a lot of it."

Next Steps,"I see. Last time, we set some goals for you. How did the mindfulness practice and bedtime routine go? One idea could be to set a reminder on your phone to start winding down at a certain time. Would that be something you’d consider? I might call another friend I haven’t talked to in a while. I could try journaling. I used to do it a lot. That’s a great idea! Writing can be a powerful outlet for emotions. How about setting aside some time to journal this week? I can do that. Excellent! Before we finish today, let’s summarize our goals for the upcoming week. You’ll try to establish a bedtime routine with reminders, practice mindfulness, reach out to another friend, and start journaling. Does that sound good?"
