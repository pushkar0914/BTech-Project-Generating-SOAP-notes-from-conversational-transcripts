Current Functional Status,"Hi Ellie! Things have been pretty busy, but I managed to take my daughter to the park like we talked about. It was really nice. We had a picnic, and we talked a lot.

Next Steps,I’d like to keep having those outings. Maybe we can do something different next time. Maybe a movie night or going to a museum. She loves learning new things. That could help. I’ll try to be more structured with my time. I haven’t thought about that. I guess I could connect with some of them. I think I might add some light stretching or breathing exercises before bed. I’m excited to try it. I think it could help me relax even more. I want to show him the importance of hard work and kindness. I don’t want him to feel the pressure I sometimes do. I guess by showing him how I handle challenges and encouraging him to be kind to others. I think that’s a good idea. I’ll look for opportunities to talk to him about it.
