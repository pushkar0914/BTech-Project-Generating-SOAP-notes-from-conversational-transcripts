Hi! It’s great to see you again. How did the journaling go this past week?,T,Insignificant
It went surprisingly well! I found it helpful to get my thoughts down before bed.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! Did you notice any changes in your dreams or anxiety levels?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"I still feel them, but writing them down made them seem less overwhelming.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a healthy perspective. Have you been able to share those feelings with anyone at work?,T,Insignificant
Not yet. I’m still a bit hesitant to open up.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Sure, I think that would help.",P,Insignificant
"Great! Let’s say you’re speaking to your supervisor. You could start with, “I wanted to talk about how I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with my workload…” ",T,Insignificant
"Okay, “I wanted to talk about how I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with my workload. I’ve been trying to manage my tasks, but I think I could use some support.”",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Excellent! Now, let’s discuss your exercise routine. Have you been able to stick to those short walks?",T,Insignificant
"I managed to go for a walk a few times this week, but I still struggle with consistency.",P,Current Functional Status
"That’s a common challenge. It might help to schedule those walks into your day, like an appointment. ",T,Insignificant
That’s a good idea. I could set reminders on my phone.,P,Insignificant
"Exactly! Creating a routine can help make it a habit. How about pairing the walks with something enjoyable, like listening to music or a podcast?",T,Insignificant
I like that idea! I’ll try that next time.,P,Insignificant
