"I think I'm good at it, but sometimes I worry about saying the wrong thing.  ",P,Risk Assessment
"It's understandable to have those worries. What do you think might happen if you said something ""wrong""?  ",T,Insignificant
I guess they might not like me anymore.  ,P,Risk Assessment
That sounds tough. Let's explore that fear a bit. Can you think of a time when you felt you said something wrong?  ,T,Insignificant
"Um, yeah. At a party once, I made a joke that didn't land well.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

Embarrassed.  ,P,Risk Assessment

That's a common experience! What goes through your mind when that happens?  ,T,Insignificant
I just want to disappear.  ,P,Risk Assessment
I understand. It can be really uncomfortable. How do you think you could respond differently in those moments?  ,T,Insignificant
Maybe just laugh and move on?  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds like a positive approach. Would you like to practice that mindset?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think that could help.  ",P,Insignificant
Great! Let's think of some affirmations you could tell yourself in those moments. What might one be?  ,T,Insignificant
"Um, ""It's okay to make mistakes.""  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That's a wonderful affirmation! How about we set a goal for you to use that affirmation next time you feel embarrassed?  ,T,Next Steps
"Okay, I can try that.  ",P,Insignificant

I still struggle with it.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What do you think is the biggest barrier for you in overcoming procrastination?  ,T,Insignificant

That’s understandable. What types of tasks do you find yourself procrastinating on the most?  ,T,Insignificant
Mostly chores or things for work.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Would it help to break those tasks into smaller steps?  ,T,Insignificant
