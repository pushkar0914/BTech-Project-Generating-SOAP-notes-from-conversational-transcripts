Excellent! Have you had any moments since our last session where you felt overwhelmed?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Actually, yes. I had an audition last week, and I was really anxious leading up to it.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Auditions can be nerve-wracking. How did you cope with that anxiety?  ,T,Insignificant

"I felt nervous, but I think I did okay. I just reminded myself that it was practice.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a healthy perspective! Focusing on the experience rather than the outcome can reduce pressure.  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I need to remind myself of that more often.  ",P,Insignificant
"Absolutely. It’s a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. How did you feel afterward?  ",T,Insignificant

"I did, actually. I wrote about my disappointment and how it’s hard not to take it personally.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a good reflection. Remember, rejection is a part of the process in acting. It doesn’t define your worth or talent.  ",T,Insignificant
"I know, but it’s tough to remember that sometimes.  ",P,Insignificant
"It is, and that’s completely understandable. How can you remind yourself of your strengths during these times?  ",T,Insignificant
