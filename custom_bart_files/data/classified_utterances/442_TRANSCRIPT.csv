i can be outgoing 'cause i do uh like to go to  nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and,P,Psychosocial History

we just recently broke up about two three weeks ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
because of a argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do,P,Insignificant

uh,P,Insignificant
well it's it's probably it's,P,Insignificant
no one no no situation actually can be,P,Insignificant
i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time there's probably always a better way to handle it,P,Insignificant
after the fact,P,Insignificant
but uh,P,Insignificant
i would say back in the day back in the eighties when me and my  wife broke up,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i think i could've handled that one better because i was younger more hot tempered,P,Insignificant
and more irrational so i could've handled that one better yes,P,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
what the uh uh the way i broke the way i handled that situation,P,Insignificant
