Hi there! Welcome back. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been trying to practice the breathing exercises and the calm responses we talked about.,P,Progress Evaluation
That’s wonderful to hear! Have you had a chance to use them in real-life situations?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I actually had a moment at the grocery store where someone cut in front of me. I took a deep breath and calmly said, “Excuse me, I was waiting in line.”",P,Current Functional Status
That’s fantastic! How did that go for you?,T,Insignificant
Surprisingly well! The person apologized and moved back. I felt proud of myself for staying calm.,P,Mental Health Observations
You should be proud! That’s a huge accomplishment. How did it make you feel afterward?,T,Insignificant
I felt relieved and a bit more confident. ,P,Mental Health Observations
"That’s a great feeling to have. Building that confidence is key. Last time, we mentioned exploring your trust issues. How have you been feeling about that?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve been thinking a lot about it. I realize I have a hard time letting people in, even my friends.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a significant insight. Trust can be a complex issue, especially with your past experiences. Can you share more about what makes it difficult for you?",T,Insignificant
"I guess I’m afraid of being hurt or betrayed. I’ve been let down before, and it just makes me wary.",P,Trauma History
It’s understandable to feel that way after experiencing pain. Have you noticed any patterns in your relationships that reflect this fear?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I tend to keep people at arm’s length. I don’t let them see the real me.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a protective mechanism. While it keeps you safe, it can also prevent deeper connections. What do you think would happen if you allowed someone to get closer?",T,Insignificant
"I think I’d feel vulnerable, and that scares me. ",P,Risk Assessment
"Vulnerability can be daunting, but it can also lead to more meaningful relationships. What steps do you think you could take to start opening up a bit?",T,Insignificant
Maybe I could share something small about myself with a friend and see how they respond.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a great plan! Starting small can help build trust gradually. Is there someone you feel comfortable with that you could try this with?,T,Insignificant
I have a friend I’ve known for years. I think I could try it with her.,P,Next Steps
That’s a perfect choice! Sharing a little bit about your feelings or experiences can pave the way for deeper conversations. How do you feel about that idea?,T,Insignificant
I feel a little nervous but also excited. ,P,Mental Health Observations
"That’s a natural reaction! It’s okay to feel nervous when trying something new. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Would you like to role-play how that conversation might go?",T,Insignificant
"Sure, that could help.",P,Insignificant
Great! I’ll be your friend. You can start whenever you’re ready.,T,Insignificant
"Okay. *deep breath* Hey, I wanted to share something with you.",P,Insignificant
Sure! What’s on your mind?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been struggling with trusting people lately. I tend to keep my guard up, and I’m trying to work on it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate your honesty. ,T,Insignificant
How did that feel?,P,Insignificant
It felt good to say it out loud. ,P,Mental Health Observations
That’s a positive step! It’s all about building that comfort level. How can we continue to support you in this area?,T,Insignificant
I think I need to keep practicing these conversations and maybe even journal about my feelings.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Journaling can be a great tool for processing your emotions. It can help you reflect on your experiences and understand your feelings better. ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I’ll definitely try that.,P,Insignificant
"Perfect! As we wrap up today, what are your goals for our next session?",T,Insignificant
I want to check in on how the conversation with my friend goes and possibly explore more about why I feel the way I do about trust.,P,Next Steps
