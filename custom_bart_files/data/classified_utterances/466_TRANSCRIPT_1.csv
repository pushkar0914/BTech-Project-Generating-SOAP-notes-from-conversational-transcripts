"Hi, it’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"Hi, Ellie. I've been okay, I guess. Still working through some things.",P,Insignificant
"That’s understandable. Last time, you mentioned feeling immobilized by your agoraphobia. Have you had any experiences with that since we last spoke?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yes, I tried going for a short walk outside. It was challenging, but I managed to do it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a big step! How did it feel to be outside?,T,Insignificant
It was kind of freeing but also terrifying. I felt really anxious at first.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s completely normal to feel that way. What strategies did you use to cope with the anxiety during your walk?,T,Insignificant
I practiced some deep breathing exercises before I left. I also reminded myself that I could turn back if it got too overwhelming.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds like a good plan. How effective were those strategies for you?,T,Insignificant
"They helped somewhat, but I still felt a lot of panic. It’s like my mind is always racing.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I can see how that would be difficult. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that trigger your panic during these moments?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yes, I often think about what could go wrong, like getting lost or having a panic attack in public.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Those thoughts can be quite distressing. Would you be open to trying some cognitive restructuring techniques to challenge those thoughts?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, I’m willing to give it a try.",P,Insignificant
"Great! Let’s start by identifying one of those negative thoughts. For example, if you think, “I’ll get lost,” what evidence do you have to support that thought?",T,Insignificant
"Well, I mean, I have gotten lost before, but it wasn’t that bad.",P,Insignificant
And what happened when you got lost? Did you manage to find your way back?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I did. I just had to ask someone for directions.",P,Insignificant

"Yes, let’s do that.",P,Insignificant
"Okay, what’s another thought that comes up for you when you’re feeling anxious about going out?",T,Insignificant
"I often think, “What if I have a panic attack?”",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Let’s break that down. What evidence do you have that supports that thought?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve had panic attacks before, and they were really scary.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s valid. But have you also noticed that you’ve survived those panic attacks? ,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I have. It was awful, but I did get through it.",P,Insignificant
So how could you reframe that thought?,T,Insignificant
