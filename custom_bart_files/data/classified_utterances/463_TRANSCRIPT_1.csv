Hi again! It’s good to see you back. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Hi Ellie! I’ve been okay, just busy with work and waiting for my nursing license.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Have you had any updates on your license?,T,Insignificant
"Not yet, but I’m trying to stay patient. I keep checking the mail!",P,Insignificant
That’s a good approach. How has work been for you lately?,T,Insignificant
"It’s been alright. I still work at the retail store, but I’m finding it a bit exhausting.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I can imagine. You mentioned working early hours. How are you managing with that?,T,Insignificant
"It’s tough. I feel tired a lot, and sometimes I don’t get enough sleep.",P,Physiological Observations
Sleep is really important. Have you tried anything to help improve your sleep quality?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried to go to bed earlier, but it’s hard when I get home late.",P,Physiological Observations
That makes sense. Maybe we could explore some relaxation techniques that could help you unwind before bed?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, that sounds good. I could use some help with that.",P,Insignificant
Great! One technique is progressive muscle relaxation. Have you heard of it before?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"No, I haven’t. How does it work?",P,Insignificant
It involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body. This can help reduce tension and prepare you for sleep. Would you like to try it together?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, I’d like to try it.",P,Insignificant
"Okay, let’s start with your feet. Take a deep breath in, tense your feet as hard as you can, and hold for a few seconds. Now release. How did that feel?",T,Insignificant
It felt nice to let go of the tension.,P,Mental Health Observations
Good! Now let’s move up to your calves. Tense them and hold… and release. You can continue this process all the way up your body. ,T,Insignificant
I think I can do that. I’ll try it tonight.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a plan! Let’s talk about something else. You mentioned feeling a bit grumpy when you don’t sleep well. Have you noticed any changes in your mood?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been a bit more irritable at work. I think it’s because of the lack of sleep.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Mental Health Observations
That makes sense. It’s common for sleep deprivation to affect mood. Have you had any conflicts with coworkers lately?,T,Insignificant
"Not really, but I feel like I’m on edge sometimes, and I don’t want to snap at anyone.",P,Risk Assessment
It’s good that you’re aware of it. What do you think you could do to manage those feelings at work?,T,Insignificant
Maybe I could take short breaks to breathe and calm down when I feel overwhelmed.,P,Next Steps
That’s a great idea! Taking breaks can really help reset your mind. Have you had a chance to talk to your manager about your workload?,T,Insignificant
I haven’t yet. I’m a bit nervous to bring it up.,P,Insignificant
Understandable. It can be tough to advocate for yourself. What do you think is holding you back from having that conversation?,T,Insignificant
I guess I don’t want to seem like I can’t handle my job.,P,Insignificant
It’s important to remember that everyone has limits. Asking for support doesn’t mean you’re not capable. Would you like to role-play that conversation?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yes, that could help me feel more prepared.",P,Insignificant
Okay! Let’s say I’m your manager. How would you start the conversation?,T,Insignificant
"Um, I would say something like, “Can I talk to you about my workload?”",P,Insignificant
That’s a good start! How do you think your manager would respond?,T,Insignificant
"I think he might be understanding, but I’m not sure.",P,Insignificant
It’s possible! You could also express how the workload is affecting your performance. Would that feel comfortable for you?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I could say that.",P,Insignificant
"Excellent! Remember, it’s about finding a balance that works for you. Let’s move on to your family. You mentioned feeling close to them. How have they been supporting you lately?",T,Insignificant
They’ve been really encouraging about my nursing career. They keep asking about my license.,P,Psychosocial History
That’s wonderful! It sounds like they’re proud of you. How does their support make you feel?,T,Insignificant
It makes me feel good. I appreciate that they care.,P,Insignificant
Support from loved ones can be really uplifting. Have you thought about sharing your feelings about work with them?,T,Insignificant
"I haven’t, but I think I should. They might have some good advice.",P,Insignificant
"Absolutely! Sometimes, just talking about it can help you feel lighter. Is there anything else on your mind today?",T,Insignificant
I guess I’m just worried about the future. I want to start my career as a nurse soon.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valid concern. It’s natural to feel anxious about starting something new. What steps can you take to prepare for that transition?,T,Insignificant
I could start updating my resume and looking for job openings.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a proactive approach! Would you like to set a goal for this week around that?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I’ll aim to update my resume by the end of the week.",P,Next Steps
Great! I’m looking forward to hearing how that goes. Let’s wrap up for today. Remember to practice the relaxation technique and consider having that conversation with your manager. ,T,Next Steps
"Thank you, Ellie! I appreciate your help.",P,Insignificant
You’re welcome! I’ll see you next time. Take care!,T,Insignificant
Bye!,P,Insignificant
