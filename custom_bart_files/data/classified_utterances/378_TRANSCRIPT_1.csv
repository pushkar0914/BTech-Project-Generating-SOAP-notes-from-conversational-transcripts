It’s completely normal to feel nervous about networking. What do you think is holding you back?  ,T,Insignificant
I guess I worry about rejection or feeling like I don’t belong.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Those feelings are valid. What if we brainstorm some ways to approach this?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, that could help.  ",P,Insignificant
How about starting with informational interviews? You could reach out to people and ask for a short chat about their experiences.  ,T,Next Steps
That sounds less intimidating than asking for a job outright.  ,P,Insignificant

I can do that. I’ll try to find a few contacts.  ,P,Next Steps
