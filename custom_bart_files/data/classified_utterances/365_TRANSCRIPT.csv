what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids,P,Psychosocial History
uh often,P,Insignificant
or as often as i should,P,Insignificant
i've just been so busy with trying to,P,Insignificant
get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to,P,Insignificant
you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
you have no idea,P,Insignificant
do you find it easy to be a parent,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it's it comes natural but it's no way easy,P,Insignificant
and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do,P,Insignificant
but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away,P,Psychosocial History
and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a,P,Insignificant
and i feel bad that i don't see them you know,P,Psychosocial History
but,P,Insignificant
the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's the hardest thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
fear,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear,P,Insignificant
that,P,Insignificant
something awful is gonna happen,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
not seeing them it,P,Insignificant
brings about that fear a lot more,P,Insignificant
you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it,P,Insignificant
it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and i i at least i used to see them,P,Insignificant
it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
that's the that's the hardest thing i've had,P,Insignificant
to do as a parent,P,Insignificant
is to,P,Insignificant
step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for,P,Insignificant
i don't know what my future holds,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
the hardest thing is being,P,Insignificant
so far away from them,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry to hear that,T,Insignificant
what's the best thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day,P,Insignificant
and they just cheer me right up,P,Insignificant
i mean,P,Insignificant
i eh,P,Insignificant
it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away,P,Insignificant
and just not seeing their faces that's,P,Insignificant
it's it's the worst thing ever you know,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents,T,Insignificant
well um,P,Insignificant
i think,P,Insignificant
the fact that i can,P,Insignificant
get down to their level,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter>,P,Insignificant
as a father than my dad was with me my dad was,P,Insignificant
you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but,P,Insignificant
you know he was always very reserved,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because,P,Insignificant
you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
i always love to,P,Insignificant
you know play around with them,P,Insignificant
as much as possible,P,Insignificant
you know not,P,Insignificant
i don't want them to grow up too fast,P,Insignificant
and that that may have been,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
well <sigh>,P,Insignificant
a situation that i wish i would've handled differently,P,Insignificant
there's so many <laughter>,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i guess when i was still with my ex-wife,P,Insignificant
in florida,P,Insignificant
i wish i wouldn't have,P,Insignificant
gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions,P,Insignificant
she had a tendency to,P,Insignificant
get underneath my skin,P,Insignificant
and uh you know,P,Insignificant
keep picking at me until,P,Insignificant
i exploded,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
i allowed her to do that,P,Insignificant
you know i i should've just,P,Insignificant
walked away when i could,P,Insignificant
and um you know not let my temper get the best of me,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever served in the military,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
uh sometimes it's hard,P,Physiological Observations
um,P,Insignificant
sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through,P,Physiological Observations
with work and you know,P,Insignificant
making sure,P,Insignificant
you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent,P,Insignificant
you know wondering what my kids are going through,P,Insignificant
you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore,P,Insignificant
if they even know they have a father,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
those are some of the things that run through my head and,P,Insignificant
and that keeps me up at night sometimes,P,Physiological Observations
do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself,T,Insignificant
a little <sigh> but <sigh>,P,Insignificant
you know i put myself in this situation so,P,Insignificant
you know i i gotta,P,Insignificant
bear with it you know i gotta,P,Insignificant
you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh>,P,Insignificant
i gotta deal with it in my own way,P,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
lately,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i've been trying to,P,Insignificant
not think so much about,P,Insignificant
you know all that's going into my life,P,Insignificant
uh i try to distract myself,P,Insignificant
and that kind of,P,Insignificant
gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or,P,Insignificant
just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know,P,Insignificant
all the stresses in my life,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
the last time i felt really happy,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um,P,Substance Use History
with a couple of my friends from work and um,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
we just got,P,Insignificant
pretty drunk and just <laughter>,P,Substance Use History
that kinda helped me to forget,P,Insignificant
all the crap that was,P,Insignificant
previously going through my head,P,Insignificant
so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that,P,Insignificant
other stuff,P,Insignificant
then i'm happy <sigh>,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter>,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
uh i'm kind of like a,P,Insignificant
i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting,P,Insignificant
or i may,P,Insignificant
um you know just listen to people so you know eh,P,Insignificant
i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something,P,Insignificant
troubling times like like i'm going through,P,Insignificant
can you give me an example of that,T,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
uh who lives in florida,P,Insignificant
you know i talk to him every now and then and,P,Insignificant
he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and,P,Insignificant
you know i just kind of,P,Insignificant
talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to,P,Insignificant
you know when i was living in florida,P,Insignificant
i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me,P,Insignificant
and now that i'm here in l_a,P,Insignificant
i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so,P,Insignificant
he um,P,Insignificant
he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice,P,Insignificant
you know about what i think you know he should do,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that,P,Insignificant
uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
i don't know <sigh> um,P,Insignificant
sometimes i wish i wasn't so,P,Insignificant
kind or generous,P,Insignificant
it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me,P,Insignificant
and i may not realize it,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
i don't like saying no to people i like,P,Insignificant
to always please people,P,Insignificant
so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser,P,Insignificant
has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
help others and not you know,P,Insignificant
that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to,P,Insignificant
pay bills but,P,Insignificant
i feel better helping people,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
i regret,P,Insignificant
not,P,Insignificant
breaking up with my ex-wife sooner,P,Insignificant
i regret <re> i regret <re>,P,Insignificant
why,T,Insignificant
because she put me through so much crap in my life,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
i was always trying to,P,Insignificant
be a people pleaser i was trying to please her,P,Insignificant
you know trying to,P,Insignificant
please my kids as much as i can,P,Insignificant
by not breaking up you know the family,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
you know there's only so much one person can take,P,Insignificant
and i i think probably if i would've left sooner,P,Insignificant
i may have been happier,P,Insignificant
and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
during all those years with her,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
maybe if i would've got out sooner,P,Insignificant
i don't know i would've been happier i guess,P,Insignificant
i see,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it's okay to be selfish,P,Insignificant
it's okay to,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
think about yourself sometimes,P,Insignificant
you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you,P,Insignificant
then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy,P,Insignificant
and even though,P,Insignificant
pleasing people may make you happy,P,Insignificant
uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs,P,Insignificant
because,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
you play an important role,P,Insignificant
in,P,Insignificant
the lives of your close family members,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
in order to keep everything afloat,P,Insignificant
you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's,P,Insignificant
you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so,P,Insignificant
be a little selfish sometimes it's okay,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
i don't even know what a weekend is anymore,P,Insignificant
my ideal weekend would be,P,Insignificant
locked away alone in my room,P,Insignificant
watching movies listening to music just,P,Insignificant
with my,P,Insignificant
cell phone off and,P,Insignificant
not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar,P,Insignificant
you know or you know watching a a metal show,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
i like to be alone,P,Insignificant
but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
crazy <laughter>,P,Insignificant
he thinks i'm uh,P,Insignificant
i'm crazy for coming out here,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded,P,Insignificant
and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter,P,Insignificant
how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight,P,Insignificant
but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm,P,Insignificant
crazy but,P,Insignificant
strong-minded <laughter>,P,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Psychosocial History
my kids <sigh>,P,Insignificant
you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy,P,Insignificant
are my kids and,P,Insignificant
you know just having them in my life is is the,P,Insignificant
proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them,P,Insignificant
in my life,P,Insignificant
and although i don't get to see them as much,P,Insignificant
even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know,P,Insignificant
how far they've gone,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
what what they've accomplished in their you know,P,Insignificant
in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy,P,Insignificant
and i can't wait to see them again,P,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
one of my most memorable experiences,P,Insignificant
i guess that would be,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
in florida,P,Insignificant
