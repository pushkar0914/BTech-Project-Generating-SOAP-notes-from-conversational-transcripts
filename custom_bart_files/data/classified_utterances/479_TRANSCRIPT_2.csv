How about the mindfulness breathing? Did you give it a try? ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I forgot most nights. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Yeah, probably. ",P,Next Steps
Great! Let’s try that. What about the budget? ,T,Insignificant
I didn’t do that either. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

That sounds better. ,P,Next Steps

Have you noticed any physical symptoms when you feel stressed? ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I get headaches sometimes. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s tough. Have you tried any physical activities to help with that? ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been working out, but it doesn’t always help. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like you’re doing your best. Have you considered talking to a doctor about your headaches? ,T,Next Steps
Not really. ,P,Insignificant
