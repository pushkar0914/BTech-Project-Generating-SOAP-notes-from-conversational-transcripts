Hi! Welcome back. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Hi Ellie! I’ve been trying to practice mindfulness, like we discussed. It’s been a bit of a challenge, but I’m getting there.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s great to hear! What has been the most challenging part for you?,T,Insignificant
I think it’s just remembering to take those moments for myself. I get so caught up in work and other responsibilities.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s completely understandable. It can be easy to prioritize everything else over self-care. Have you found any particular times or situations where it’s easier to practice mindfulness?,T,Insignificant
I’ve noticed that I can do it during my breaks at work. It helps me reset a bit.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! Taking those small breaks can really make a difference. Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels since you started practicing?,T,Insignificant
I think so. I feel a bit less overwhelmed when I take those moments to breathe.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s wonderful progress! Let’s build on that. How about setting a specific time each day for mindfulness, even if it’s just for a few minutes?",T,Insignificant
I could try that. Maybe in the morning before I start my day?,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a perfect plan! Establishing a routine can help reinforce the habit. How do you feel about journaling your experiences as well?,T,Insignificant
I’ve started journaling! It’s been nice to get my thoughts out on paper.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s excellent! What have you been writing about?,T,Insignificant
Mostly about my feelings regarding work and my daughter. It helps me see things more clearly.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great way to reflect. Have you noticed any patterns or recurring themes in what you’re writing?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I keep coming back to my worries about being a good parent and my anxiety about work.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. Would you like to explore those concerns further today?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I think I need to. I want to be a supportive parent, but sometimes I feel like I’m not doing enough.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s common for parents to feel that way. What does “doing enough” look like for you?,T,Insignificant
I guess being emotionally available and supportive. I just don’t want to overstep or make her feel like I’m judging her.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valid concern. Have you considered asking her directly what kind of support she needs from you?,T,Insignificant
"I haven’t, but it sounds like a good idea. I just worry I’ll come off as overbearing.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Open communication is key. By asking her what she needs, you’re showing that you care and want to support her in a way that feels comfortable for her.",T,Insignificant
You’re right. I’ll try to have that conversation soon.,P,Next Steps
I’m glad to hear that! It can be a great way to strengthen your relationship. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your work anxiety?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with deadlines and expectations. I worry that I won’t meet them.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common feeling in high-pressure environments. Have you thought about how you can break down your tasks to make them feel more manageable?,T,Insignificant
I haven’t really tried that. I usually just dive in and hope for the best.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Breaking tasks into smaller, more achievable steps can help reduce anxiety. You could create a to-do list and prioritize what needs to be done first.",T,Next Steps
That sounds helpful. I’ll give it a shot.,P,Next Steps
Great! Remember to celebrate small victories as you complete tasks. It can help boost your confidence.,T,Next Steps
I’ll try to remember that. I tend to overlook my accomplishments.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s easy to do, but acknowledging your progress is important for your mental well-being. Is there anything else you’d like to cover today?",T,Insignificant
"No, I think we’ve covered a lot. Thank you for your support.",P,Insignificant
