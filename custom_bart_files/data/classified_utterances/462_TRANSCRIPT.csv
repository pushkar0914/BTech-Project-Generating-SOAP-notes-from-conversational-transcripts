fun and it's it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to,P,Insignificant

fantastic um sights and and,P,Insignificant
<ss> and cultures,P,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
um uh well i mean um uh,P,Insignificant
i i tended to actually do a lot of them um i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a person now i,P,Insignificant
i um i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for,P,Psychosocial History
spain was fun spain it madrid is a party town and then um,P,Insignificant
and then so these were all work they were all work so i was working so it was um,P,Insignificant
there's a grind there you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then,P,Insignificant
i mean i still um,P,Insignificant
i still i love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really,P,Psychosocial History
a sucker for that kind of stuff,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i guess madagascar,P,Psychosocial History
was pretty much like just,P,Insignificant
really bitching because it was um it was in the eighties and,P,Insignificant
it was like you were seeing a lot of,P,Insignificant
uh people that had never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might've been lying,P,Insignificant
um but it was just it was bitching africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah,P,Psychosocial History
nice,T,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
um i'm right now about to go for an early childhood education,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just to,P,Insignificant
just to get the um,P,Insignificant
just to get the stipend i didn't really have any concept of what i wanna do now i really do,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
i have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys were able to overhear i really think that um,P,Insignificant
the way the school system goes right now it um it just it,P,Insignificant
it turns people into,P,Insignificant
into um just um,P,Insignificant
just uh dog eat dog um you know i i don't like the way,P,Insignificant
the people <peo> it i think it's so draining the um school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i wanna try to fix that,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
that would be my dream job that so i'm excited that like i wanna go in a direction that i wanna go in and yeah that would be my dream job is to work,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
with sort of getting um kids on a more um organic universal,P,Insignificant
um you know uh trajectory,P,Insignificant
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i think it could be done i don't think it would be done via,P,Insignificant
any sort of um,P,Insignificant
legislation,P,Insignificant
except here and there i mean it it that always ends up for becoming you know,P,Insignificant
facade and farce itself anyway but i think there are ways,P,Insignificant
i've always reached kids anyway and they've always felt where i was coming from and so,P,Insignificant
i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
uh i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know actually i'm kinda i might even be working that out there might some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa so you don't know,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
<laughter> yeah,P,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
yeah that's cool,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i definitely um,P,Insignificant
uh try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible so,P,Current Functional Status
a lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot,P,Current Functional Status
so that's,P,Insignificant
quite soothing i try not to do i don't really do anything that's too,P,Insignificant
tense unless it's time for it like time to drive to a job or time to,P,Insignificant
you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise,P,Insignificant
um i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like break and,P,Insignificant
but you know and i,P,Insignificant
i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer's coming so i'm gonna swim some more too,P,Current Functional Status
mhm,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um when i'm truly outraged uh it comes out and then i i'm i'm i'm hitting some kind of,P,Insignificant
bad parts right now 'cause it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child so,P,Risk Assessment
there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam,P,Risk Assessment
has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
a little bit but usually pretty much there's always um,P,Insignificant
you know someone,P,Insignificant
in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so,P,Insignificant
usually some kind of sanity can prevail,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
oh well i mean these are times where i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat out,P,Insignificant
you know um sabotaged or or definitely just,P,Insignificant
when uh what's the last specific time well i,P,Insignificant
you know i lost my temper dreadfully with um unfortunately um,P,Risk Assessment
the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of,P,Insignificant
i mean she's pretty much a horrible person so i i recently lost my temper with her,P,Risk Assessment
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
i felt like um,P,Insignificant
i mean i like again um i think i sort of said this just now i felt,P,Insignificant
in a way,P,Insignificant
good because,P,Insignificant
i get it,P,Insignificant
you know which is as opposed to not getting it,P,Insignificant
which is,P,Insignificant
even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank,P,Insignificant
of,P,Insignificant
the thing to get to to where,P,Insignificant
you can be a little more constructive about it it's like,P,Insignificant
you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty,P,Insignificant
but so i mean i don't <do> i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame i didn't i didn't feel,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
there are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because,P,Insignificant
there are people that will try to use that against you that's all,P,Insignificant
but i never really feel bad for,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
being angry about what i'm angry about,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
well when i was pregnant i wish i had um,P,Insignificant
like i said um i i went through um,P,Insignificant
such an awakening about realizing when i was being,P,Insignificant
sort of um undermined that um,P,Insignificant
that demanding my respect became a huge issue and,P,Insignificant
when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place 'cause i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so i always felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where,P,Insignificant
um i was set to be when the child arrived that i,P,Insignificant
stormed out,P,Insignificant
via what was a good survival mode before but,P,Insignificant
left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
it's fucked up,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
i don't want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and,P,Insignificant
cohesive,P,Insignificant
i don't,P,Insignificant
and integrated i don't wanna erase anything from my memory,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
um well did i get it right or did i get it wrong,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
um yeah i'm uh i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to,P,Insignificant
sign um,P,Insignificant
sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and i should've said no let's just go straight to court because the,P,Insignificant
there is nothing wrong with me i just,P,Insignificant
happen to,P,Insignificant
succumb to an s_s_i check via bullshit with my mother and i should've just,P,Insignificant
been you know,P,Insignificant
um brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out,P,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
overcautiousness,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
it's,P,Insignificant
horrific horrendous bourgeoise quality,P,Psychosocial History
intrigue and sabotage it's bad,P,Psychosocial History
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
it's okay,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
someone that i mean,P,Insignificant
there's been um,P,Insignificant
you know there's been some,P,Insignificant
some great people uh again from afar i have not sort of,P,Insignificant
really um,P,Insignificant
achieved a real great ability to build relationships and i'm working through that right right right <r> right now and i think that's a lot why i don't have my son but,P,Psychosocial History
as i've grown and developed i've seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so that's wonderful and um,P,Insignificant
but otherwise you know a constant,P,Insignificant
you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to um,P,Insignificant
get to that point,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Physiological Observations
not so easy these days at all,P,Physiological Observations
why,T,Insignificant
um i'm being i've been um i'm not,P,Insignificant
completely centered and then there's been some,P,Insignificant
um actual you know,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so there's been actual harassment,P,Risk Assessment
and stuff like that,P,Insignificant
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm still pretty pollyanna'd out i still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible,P,Current Functional Status
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
i'm tired and drained and a little bit um frustrated because that i know that um,P,Physiological Observations
i've been sort of,P,Insignificant
that i sort of have a bit of,P,Insignificant
um my um energy and and space being usurped <u> usurped and i can tell and i don't know how to get through that and past it,P,Current Functional Status
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
there are i'm i'm i'm basically very very very happy pretty much,P,Insignificant
blissed out person but,P,Insignificant
um this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that,P,Insignificant
it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before i realized i was such a happy person,P,Insignificant
are thrown there again so i'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but,P,Insignificant
you know um during the day i'll i'll i'll i'll think something completely true and organic and i i'll just stare at something and go wow that's beautiful and i'll be reminded that i'm,P,Insignificant
pretty close to my spirit so,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i try to stay there twenty four seven i'm pretty spiritual that way,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
um uh,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant

that you know that i'm this is off you guys,P,Insignificant
that i'm funny and that um,P,Insignificant
and that um,P,Insignificant
i think that's bad um that i'm funny and that i'm good and that that i'm trustworthy,P,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
just uh i'm i'm i not necessarily change but grow through um my ability to connect with the people i wanna connect with,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and disconnect from the people that,P,Insignificant
manage to,P,Insignificant
to,P,Insignificant
drain me,P,Insignificant
i see,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
i already said i regret the thing with um,P,Insignificant
leaving the place where i could've delivered my son even though i was being,P,Insignificant
um uh sort of,P,Insignificant
abused,P,Risk Assessment
right,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
