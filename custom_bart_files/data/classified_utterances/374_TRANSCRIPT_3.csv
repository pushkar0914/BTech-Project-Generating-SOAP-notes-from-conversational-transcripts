That’s fantastic! What insights have you gained from your sleep journal?,T,Insignificant
I noticed that I sleep worse on days when I’m really stressed about job searching. It’s like a cycle that feeds into itself.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Physiological Observations

"I think I need to be more mindful about my job search, maybe set specific times to work on it instead of letting it consume my day.",P,Next Steps

"Yeah, I realized I often write about feeling inadequate and comparing myself to others. It’s something I struggle with a lot.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Psychosocial History
Recognizing that pattern is a big step. How do you think you can challenge those thoughts of inadequacy?,T,Insignificant
"I could remind myself of my strengths and accomplishments, like we talked about. Maybe even write those down and keep them visible.",P,Next Steps
