Hi again! It's great to see you back. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Hey, Ellie. I've been okay, just keeping busy with work and the little one.",P,Insignificant
That's good to hear. You mentioned feeling like you have a wealth of queries and potential just out of reach. Have you had any thoughts on what that connection might be?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it. I feel like I need to set clearer goals for myself, but I’m not sure where to start.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Setting goals can definitely be a helpful way to create that connection. What kind of goals are you considering?,T,Insignificant
I want to focus on my career and maybe take a few classes to improve my skills with computers. I think that would help me feel more accomplished.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a solid plan. What skills do you want to work on specifically?,T,Insignificant
I’d like to get better at coding and maybe learn more about cybersecurity. It’s something that really interests me.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Those are great areas to explore! Have you looked into any classes or resources yet?,T,Insignificant
"I found a few online courses, but I haven't signed up for anything yet.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Would it be helpful to set a goal for when you want to enroll in one of those courses?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think that would help. Maybe by the end of this month?",P,Next Steps
That sounds very achievable. It could be a good motivation to get you started. How does that feel to commit to that timeline?,T,Insignificant
It feels good. I think having a deadline will push me to take action.,P,Next Steps
"Excellent! As you work on these goals, how do you plan to balance that with your responsibilities at home?",T,Insignificant
"That’s where it gets tricky. I want to spend time with my daughter, but I also need to find time for myself.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Finding that balance can be challenging. What do you think would be a good way to carve out some time for yourself?,T,Insignificant
Maybe I could set aside an hour or two in the evenings after she goes to bed. I could use that time to study.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a reasonable plan. Have you discussed this with your wife? ,T,Insignificant
"Not yet. I think she might be supportive, but I’m worried she’ll feel like I’m neglecting family time.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Open communication is key. How do you think you could approach that conversation?,T,Insignificant
I could explain my goals and how it would ultimately benefit our family if I’m more fulfilled in my career.,P,Next Steps
That’s a great angle to take. It shows that you’re thinking about the bigger picture. Would you like to role-play that conversation here?,T,Insignificant
"Sure, that could help me prepare.",P,Insignificant
"Okay, let’s imagine you’re talking to your wife. Start with how you would greet her.",T,Insignificant
"Hey, babe. Do you have a minute to talk?",P,Insignificant
Great start! What would you say next?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been thinking a lot about my career and how I want to improve my skills.,P,Insignificant
Nice. How would you express your feelings about that?,T,Insignificant
"I feel like I have a lot of potential, but I need to take steps to reach it. I want to take some online courses.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds good. How would you reassure her about spending time together?,T,Insignificant
"I would tell her that I’ll still make time for us and our daughter. This is important to me, but family comes first.",P,Next Steps
That’s a thoughtful approach. How do you feel about practicing that conversation?,T,Insignificant
I feel more confident about it now. It’s nice to have a structure.,P,Next Steps
I’m glad to hear that! We can check in on how that conversation goes in our next session. Is there anything else on your mind today?,T,Insignificant
Just the usual worries about being a good parent. I want to make sure I’m doing everything right.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common concern among parents. What makes you feel like you’re not doing enough?,T,Insignificant
"I guess I compare myself to other parents. I see them doing all these activities with their kids, and I worry.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s easy to fall into that comparison trap. What activities do you enjoy doing with your daughter?,T,Insignificant
We go to the park and play together. She loves that.,P,Current Functional Status
That sounds wonderful! Focusing on those moments can help you feel more confident in your parenting. ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I should remind myself that those moments matter.",P,Insignificant
"Absolutely! You’re doing your best, and that’s what counts. Let’s continue to explore these feelings in our next session. ",T,Insignificant
"Sounds good. Thanks, Ellie.",P,Insignificant
"You’re welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing how everything goes.",T,Insignificant
Bye!,P,Insignificant
Goodbye!,T,Insignificant
