"Hi, it's good to see you again! How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"Hi, Ellie! I've been okay, I guess. Just kind of going through the motions, you know?",P,Insignificant
"I understand. Last time, you mentioned feeling a bit mellow but also some underlying sadness. Have those feelings changed at all?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, a little. I still feel mellow, but there are moments when I feel a bit more down. It’s like a wave, I guess.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. Can you tell me about a specific moment when you felt that wave of sadness?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Well, the other day I was out for a walk, and I saw a couple holding hands. It hit me that I’m still single, and I felt really lonely.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds tough. Loneliness can be a heavy feeling. Have you had a chance to talk to anyone about these feelings?,T,Insignificant
Not really. I don’t want to burden my friends with my stuff. I just keep it to myself.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It's understandable to feel that way, but sharing can sometimes lighten the load. Do you think it would help to express those feelings to someone close to you?",T,Insignificant
Maybe. I just worry they won’t understand or will think I’m being too dramatic.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s common to have those worries. But often, friends appreciate honesty and might surprise you with their support. Would you consider trying to share with one friend this week?",T,Next Steps
I guess I could try. There’s one friend I feel a bit closer to. ,P,Next Steps
"That sounds like a good start. Shifting gears a bit, how has your sleep been since we last spoke? Any improvements?",T,Physiological Observations
Not really. I still wake up a lot during the night. Sometimes I just lie there thinking too much.,P,Physiological Observations
It sounds like your mind is quite active at night. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried listening to music, but sometimes it feels like it doesn’t help.",P,Insignificant
"That’s understandable. Would you be open to trying a mindfulness exercise, like deep breathing or guided imagery, before sleep?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I could give that a shot. I’ve heard it helps.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Great! Let’s try this: Spend a few minutes focusing on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Okay, I’ll try that tonight.",P,Next Steps
"Wonderful! Let me know how it goes. Now, you mentioned wanting a girlfriend last time. Have you thought more about what that would look like for you?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, I think about it often. I’d like someone to share experiences with, but I feel like I’m not really putting myself out there.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common barrier. What do you think is stopping you from putting yourself out there?,T,Insignificant
I guess I’m afraid of rejection. It’s easier to just stay in my comfort zone.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valid concern. Maybe we can work on some small steps to gradually expand that comfort zone. Would you be willing to try?,T,Next Steps
"Sure, what do you have in mind?",P,Insignificant
"How about starting with small social interactions? For example, striking up a conversation with a cashier or a neighbor?",T,Next Steps
That sounds manageable. I can try that.,P,Next Steps
"Excellent! It’s all about building confidence. Remember, every small interaction counts. How do you feel about that?",T,Insignificant
"I feel a bit nervous but also a little excited, I guess.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a good sign! Embracing that mix of feelings can lead to growth. Let’s set a goal for you to have at least one new interaction this week.,T,Next Steps
Sounds good. I can do that.,P,Next Steps
"Perfect! Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind today?",T,Insignificant
"No, I think we covered a lot. Thanks, Ellie.",P,Insignificant
You’re welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how your week goes. Take care!,T,Insignificant
"Bye, Ellie!",P,Insignificant
