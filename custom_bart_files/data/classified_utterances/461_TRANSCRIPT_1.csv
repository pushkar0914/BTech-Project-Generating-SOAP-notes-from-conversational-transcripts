"Hi again, it's good to see you. How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"I've been okay, I guess. A bit up and down.",P,Insignificant
I understand. Can you tell me more about what's been causing those ups and downs?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I still feel anxious about not having a job. It weighs on me a lot.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Job searching can be stressful. Have you been able to apply for any positions?,T,Insignificant
"A few, but I keep second-guessing myself. I feel like I’m not qualified enough.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a common feeling, especially when facing uncertainty. What do you think is contributing to those feelings of inadequacy?",T,Insignificant
I think it's just my past experiences. I’ve had a lot of rejection over the years.,P,Trauma History
That sounds tough. It can be hard to keep trying when faced with rejection. How do you usually cope with those feelings?,T,Insignificant
"I try to meditate, but sometimes it just feels overwhelming.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Meditation can be a helpful tool. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies together?,T,Insignificant
"Sure, I’m open to that.",P,Insignificant
"Great! One technique we could try is cognitive restructuring, which helps challenge negative thoughts. Can you share a recent negative thought you had about yourself?",T,Insignificant
"I thought, “I’ll never find a job,” after I didn’t hear back from a couple of applications.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a powerful thought. Let’s try to challenge it. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I haven’t had much luck lately.",P,Insignificant
"True, but what evidence do you have that contradicts it? Have you had any interviews or positive feedback in the past?",T,Insignificant
"Yes, I’ve had a few interviews, and some people said I did well.",P,Current Functional Status
"Exactly! So, while it feels discouraging now, it doesn’t mean you won’t find a job. Would you like to reframe that thought?",T,Insignificant
"I guess I could say, “I’ve had some interviews, and I’m still trying.”",P,Insignificant
That’s a much healthier perspective! How does that feel to say?,T,Insignificant
"It feels a bit better, actually. ",P,Insignificant
That’s wonderful to hear. Let’s keep practicing this technique. How about we set a goal for you to apply to a certain number of jobs this week?,T,Next Steps
That sounds good. Maybe three applications?,P,Next Steps
That’s a realistic goal. How do you feel about that?,T,Insignificant
I feel like I can handle that.,P,Insignificant
"Fantastic! Now, shifting gears a bit, how have you been sleeping since we last spoke?",T,Insignificant
Not great. I still wake up a lot.,P,Physiological Observations
I’m sorry to hear that. Have you been able to try any of the relaxation techniques we discussed?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried some deep breathing before bed, but it’s hard to stick to a routine.",P,Current Functional Status
It can be challenging to establish new habits. Would you like to create a more structured bedtime routine together?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I think that would help.",P,Insignificant
Let’s break it down. What time do you usually go to bed?,T,Insignificant
"Around 11 PM, but I end up scrolling on my phone for a while.",P,Current Functional Status
"How about we aim to put your phone away an hour before bed? Instead, you could read or listen to calming music.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds nice. I could try that.,P,Insignificant
Great! And maybe incorporate some light stretching or meditation before sleep? ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I could add that in too.,P,Insignificant
"Perfect. So, your routine could look like this: put away your phone by 10 PM, do some light stretching, and then meditate for a few minutes before bed.",T,Next Steps
I like that. ,P,Insignificant
How do you feel about committing to this routine for the next week?,T,Insignificant
I’m willing to give it a shot.,P,Insignificant
Excellent! We’ll check in on how that goes in our next session. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?,T,Insignificant
I guess I just want to feel less anxious overall.,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint

Bye!,P,Insignificant
