That’s fantastic! How did it feel to get back into it?  ,T,Insignificant
It was nice. I forgot how much I enjoyed it.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I’m glad to hear that! What did you draw?  ,T,Insignificant
Just some random stuff—nothing special.  ,P,Insignificant
Sometimes the process is more important than the end result. Did you find it relaxing?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, it was a good distraction from everything else.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s great! Have you thought about making it a regular part of your routine?  ,T,Insignificant
I might. It feels good to do something creative.  ,P,Insignificant
That’s a wonderful idea! How about setting aside specific time each week for drawing?  ,T,Insignificant
I could do that. Maybe Sundays?  ,P,Insignificant
That sounds perfect! Sundays can be a good day to unwind. Did you experience any moments of feeling down this week?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
A little. Just the usual stuff—feeling lonely.  ,P,Risk Assessment
I understand. It’s tough to feel that way. Did you have any opportunities to connect with others?  ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I didn’t feel like reaching out.  ,P,Risk Assessment
That’s okay. Sometimes it can be hard to initiate contact. What do you think holds you back?  ,T,Insignificant
I guess I just don’t want to bother anyone.  ,P,Risk Assessment
"It’s understandable to feel that way, but remember that friends and acquaintances often appreciate hearing from you. Would you consider reaching out to someone this week?  ",T,Insignificant
I could try. Maybe an old friend.  ,P,Next Steps

Is there anything else you’d like to explore today?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve been thinking about my job situation.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Okay, what are your thoughts on that?  ",T,Insignificant
I’m just tired of being unemployed. I want to find something I actually enjoy.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valid feeling. Have you thought about what kind of job you’d like to pursue?  ,T,Insignificant
I’d love to work in a record shop or something music-related.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a great fit for you! Have you looked into any opportunities in that field?  ,T,Insignificant
A little. There aren’t many around here.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It can be challenging. Would you be open to exploring online opportunities or even volunteering at a local shop to gain experience?  ,T,Next Steps
That might be worth considering.  ,P,Next Steps
