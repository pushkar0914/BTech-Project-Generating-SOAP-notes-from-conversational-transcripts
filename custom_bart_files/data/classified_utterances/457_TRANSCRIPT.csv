national news and,P,Insignificant
he was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group,P,Insignificant
riding around on tall bikes and stuff the we didn't,P,Insignificant
bat an eye we didn't blink because this is this is normal for our friends that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately that was just a a happy normal sunday,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
our group of friends,P,Insignificant
is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant

tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
when ,P,Insignificant

having my <sigh>,P,Insignificant
verbal gloves up i managed to,P,Insignificant
take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was,P,Insignificant
not my most graceful moment,P,Mental Health Observations

it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but,P,Insignificant
it wasn't even that hard 'cause it pushed me to do it so,P,Insignificant
it's a tricky question madam,P,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
uh oh you know broken collarbone,P,Insignificant
severe pain get surgery on it it all seemed like it made sense at the time,P,Insignificant
i see,T,Insignificant

<laughter>,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant

she is a magical creature,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
well there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful,P,Insignificant
there's the part where she,P,Insignificant
manages to,P,Insignificant
hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she,P,Insignificant
actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part,P,Insignificant
where,P,Insignificant
she is a hundred percent kind and caring,P,Insignificant
all the time,P,Insignificant
all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that,P,Insignificant
she does this all,P,Insignificant
without wanting anything in return,P,Insignificant
i don't know that's,P,Insignificant
<sigh> smitten <laughter>,P,Insignificant

okay,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire,P,Mental Health Observations

uh has managed to convince me of the,P,Insignificant
reality,P,Insignificant
of magic,P,Insignificant
in the arthur c clark sense,P,Insignificant
