I had a bit of a setback with my anxiety. I had a panic attack last week out of nowhere.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I’m sorry to hear that. Panic attacks can be really overwhelming. What do you think triggered it?,T,Insignificant
I think it was a combination of stress from work and worrying about my family’s expectations.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. It’s important to recognize those triggers. How did you cope during the panic attack?,T,Insignificant
"I tried to use the breathing techniques we practiced, but it was hard to focus.",P,Therapeutic Interventions

"Yes, please. I could use more tools for when that happens.",P,Next Steps
"One technique is the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise. It involves identifying five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Would you like to try it together?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, let’s do it.",P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s start with five things you can see in the room.,T,Insignificant
"I see the chair, the window, the clock, the plant, and your shoes.",P,Insignificant
"Excellent! Now, what are four things you can touch?",T,Insignificant
"The chair, my phone, my shirt, and the table.",P,Insignificant
"Good job! Now, can you identify three things you can hear?",T,Insignificant
"The ticking of the clock, the sound of traffic outside, and your voice.",P,Insignificant
"Perfect! Now, what about two things you can smell?",T,Insignificant
I can smell the coffee from earlier and the fresh air from the window.,P,Insignificant
"And finally, one thing you can taste?",T,Insignificant
I can taste the mint from the gum I had earlier.,P,Insignificant
