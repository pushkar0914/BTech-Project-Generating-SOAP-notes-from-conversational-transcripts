"hi, ellie",P,Insignificant
hi! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"I've been okay, just trying to keep everything balanced with the kids and school.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a lot to juggle. Have you had any moments where you felt particularly stressed or overwhelmed?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, definitely. There were a few days where I felt like I was just running on empty, especially with the kids' activities and my school assignments piling up.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
How did you cope with those feelings?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I tried to take some time for myself, even if it was just a few minutes to breathe or meditate. But honestly, it was tough to find that time.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like you're aware of the importance of self-care. Have you been able to incorporate any new strategies since we last talked?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I’ve been trying to go to the beach more often. Just sitting there helps clear my mind.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great idea! Nature can be very grounding. How did it feel to spend that time at the beach?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It felt refreshing. I could just watch the waves and forget about everything for a moment.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your mood after those beach visits?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yes, I feel calmer and more centered. It’s like a reset button for me.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’re finding effective ways to manage stress. Have you been able to share your feelings with your friends or family?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I’ve talked to my friend a bit, but sometimes I feel like I don’t want to burden them with my problems.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you considered how sharing might strengthen those relationships?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I guess it could, but I worry they might not understand. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a valid concern. What if you approached it from a place of wanting to connect, rather than just sharing your burdens?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That could work. Maybe I should focus on how they can support me rather than just venting.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Exactly! It can be a collaborative conversation. Speaking of support, how is your schoolwork going?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s been challenging, but I’m keeping up. Some subjects are tougher than others.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Which subjects do you find most challenging?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Business is a bit hard for me. I’m trying to grasp all the concepts, but sometimes it feels overwhelming.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Have you thought about forming a study group with classmates?,T,Next Steps
That’s a good idea! I haven’t thought of that. I usually study alone.,P,Next Steps
Studying with others can provide different perspectives and make learning more enjoyable. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to classmates?,T,Next Steps
I think so. I just need to find the right people to connect with.,P,Next Steps
"That’s a great start! You have a lot of strengths in communication, so I believe you’d do well in that environment. ",T,Next Steps
"Thanks, I appreciate that. I’ll give it a try.",P,Next Steps
Wonderful! How are the boys doing? Any new developments?,T,Insignificant
"They’re doing well, but my oldest is starting to push back a little more. It’s a bit challenging.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s common during the teenage years. How have you been handling that?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I try to talk to him, but sometimes it feels like he shuts down.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Have you considered asking him open-ended questions to encourage him to share more?,T,Next Steps
I haven’t really tried that. I usually just ask him how his day was.,P,Next Steps
"Open-ended questions can invite deeper conversations. For example, asking what he enjoyed most about his day might open up more dialogue.",T,Next Steps
That makes sense. I’ll give it a shot.,P,Next Steps
Great! And how do you feel when he shuts down?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Frustrated, mostly. I just want to understand him better.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you tried expressing that to him?,T,Next Steps
"No, I haven’t. I guess I could let him know that I just want to be there for him.",P,Next Steps
That could help him feel more comfortable opening up. It might reassure him that you’re on his side.,T,Next Steps
I’ll definitely try that. Thanks for the suggestion.,P,Next Steps
You’re welcome! It sounds like you’re making some solid plans. What’s one goal you’d like to focus on before our next session?,T,Next Steps
