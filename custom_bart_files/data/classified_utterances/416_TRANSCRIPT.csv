it's a good question,P,Insignificant
i'm not really sure,P,Insignificant

astronomy,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
that sounds interesting,T,Insignificant
yeah it was,P,Insignificant
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
<tisk> i don't know just kinda fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and kinda just went down that path,P,Insignificant
are you still working in that,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
why,T,Insignificant
there's not much job opportunities so,P,Current Functional Status
it's kinda limited,P,Current Functional Status

i would like to own,P,Insignificant

a nice a bar restaurant,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
well i'd like to have something a little more upscale than,P,Insignificant
most places you go to,P,Insignificant
or at least in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of,P,Insignificant
worn out run down so,P,Insignificant
something nice something different something creative,P,Insignificant
something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
but it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really plausible,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
i'm definitely more shy,P,Psychosocial History
but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but,P,Psychosocial History
initially i'm pretty shy,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
good idea,P,Insignificant
um a lot of times i,P,Insignificant
try to just,P,Insignificant
lay back and you know do some deep breathing,P,Insignificant
just kind of clear your mind,P,Insignificant
or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book,P,Insignificant
kinda just takes your mind away,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
relax,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
learned that you shouldn't,P,Insignificant
react immediately to situations you should,P,Insignificant
you know think before you speak that type of thing,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
frustrated,P,Risk Assessment
yeah,T,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
yeah i guess,P,Insignificant
everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
<tisk> but yeah,P,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion,P,Risk Assessment
um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know,P,Risk Assessment
or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh,P,Risk Assessment
you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or,P,Risk Assessment
that type of thing,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant

<tisk> um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i went to school in san diego and i,P,Insignificant

what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i,P,Psychosocial History
i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so,P,Psychosocial History
employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others,P,Psychosocial History
