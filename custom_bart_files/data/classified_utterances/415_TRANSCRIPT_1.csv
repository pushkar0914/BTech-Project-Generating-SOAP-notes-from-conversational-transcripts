"Hi, it's Ellie again. It's great to see you back. How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"Hey! I've been okay, just busy with work and school, you know how it is.",P,Insignificant
I understand. It's a lot to juggle. Have you noticed any changes in how you're managing your stress levels since we last spoke?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, I’ve been trying to practice mindfulness a bit more. I downloaded an app that guides me through some breathing exercises.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great step! How has that been working for you?,T,Insignificant
"It helps, especially when I feel overwhelmed. I just take a few minutes to breathe and it calms me down.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Excellent! Mindfulness can be really effective. Have you been able to find time to relax and enjoy music, as you mentioned before?",T,Insignificant
I have! I’ve been listening to a lot of different genres lately. It really helps me unwind after a long day.,P,Insignificant
That’s wonderful to hear. Music can be such a powerful tool for emotional expression. Have you found any particular songs or artists that resonate with you more during tough times?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been really into some old-school R&B. It just feels comforting, you know?",P,Insignificant
"Absolutely, R&B has a way of connecting with deep emotions. Speaking of emotions, how have you been feeling overall? Any ups and downs?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Honestly, I’ve had some ups and downs. I still think about my brother sometimes, especially when I hear about police incidents on the news.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Trauma History
That makes sense. It’s completely natural to feel that way. Have you had any conversations with your family about how you’re feeling?,T,Insignificant
Not really. I don’t want to worry them. I just keep it to myself.,P,Psychosocial History
"I understand wanting to protect them, but sharing might help you process those feelings. What do you think holds you back from discussing it with them?",T,Insignificant
I guess I just don’t want them to think I’m not coping well. I want to seem strong for them.,P,Psychosocial History
That’s a common concern. It’s important to remember that vulnerability can be a strength too. It might actually bring you closer together. ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I see that. Maybe I’ll try to bring it up next time we talk.",P,Next Steps
That sounds like a good plan. How do you feel about your sleep patterns? Have they improved at all?,T,Physiological Observations
Not really. I’m still pretty much a zombie. My work schedule is all over the place.,P,Physiological Observations
Have you tried any strategies to improve your sleep hygiene?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried to limit my screen time before bed, but it’s hard with work.",P,Physiological Observations
"It can definitely be a challenge. Perhaps we could explore some other strategies together, or even set a goal for you to try this week?",T,Next Steps
"Sure, that could help!",P,Insignificant
"Great! How about setting a specific bedtime for yourself? Even if it’s just 15 minutes earlier than usual, it could help.",T,Next Steps
I can definitely try that. I usually stay up late just scrolling through my phone.,P,Insignificant
That’s a step in the right direction! What about your interactions with others? You mentioned feeling shorter with people lately. Has that continued?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, I think it has. I’ve been feeling a bit more irritable. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s understandable, especially with all the stress you’re under. Have you noticed if there are specific triggers that lead to that irritability?",T,Insignificant
Mostly when I feel overwhelmed with work or school. It’s like I just snap at little things.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like finding ways to manage your stress could be beneficial. Would you be open to practicing some assertive communication techniques to express your feelings instead of snapping?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I’d be willing to try that.,P,Insignificant
Fantastic! We can work on that together. It might help you express yourself without feeling like you’re losing control. ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds good. I want to be more mindful of how I communicate.,P,Next Steps
That’s a great intention. Let’s also talk about your goals for the future. You mentioned wanting to venture into real estate with your sisters. How is that progressing?,T,Insignificant
We’re still working on it! We just finished a course on property management.,P,Current Functional Status
That’s exciting! How did you feel about the course?,T,Insignificant
"It was really informative. I learned a lot about the legal side of things, which was a bit overwhelming but necessary.",P,Current Functional Status
That’s a big step! It sounds like you’re committed to making your dream a reality. How does that make you feel?,T,Insignificant
"It feels good, but also a bit scary. What if it doesn’t work out?",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s natural to feel apprehensive about big changes. What if we reframed that fear? Instead of focusing on what could go wrong, what if you focused on what could go right?",T,Insignificant
I like that idea. I guess I could think about the possibilities instead of just the risks.,P,Next Steps
Exactly! Embracing a growth mindset can be really empowering. You and your sisters are already doing something impressive by investing in properties together.,T,Insignificant
"Thanks, Ellie. That makes me feel a bit more confident.",P,Insignificant
"I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about taking small steps towards your goals. What’s one small action you can take this week to move closer to your dream?",T,Next Steps
Maybe I’ll start researching properties more seriously. I could set aside some time this weekend.,P,Next Steps
That sounds perfect! It’s a manageable step. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?,T,Insignificant
I think that covers it for now. I feel like I have some good things to work on.,P,Insignificant
I’m glad to hear that. You’ve made some great insights today. Let’s plan to check in on your progress next time. ,T,Next Steps
