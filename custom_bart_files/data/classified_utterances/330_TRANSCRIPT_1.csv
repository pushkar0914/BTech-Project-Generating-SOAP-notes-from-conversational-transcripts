That’s good to hear there’s been some improvement. Can you tell me what’s been helping you feel a bit better?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been trying to take more walks and listen to music when I feel stressed.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Those are great coping strategies! Have you noticed any specific situations or tasks that trigger those feelings of pressure?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)

Maybe setting smaller goals or rewards for myself would help.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a solid plan. What kind of rewards do you think would motivate you?,T,Insignificant
Maybe treating myself to a nice meal or a new book after I finish a project.,P,Next Steps
Those sound like nice rewards! Let’s set a goal for the next week. How about picking one task to break down and reward yourself after completing it?,T,Next Steps

Sometimes it happens when I feel like I’m not making progress.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. It’s common to feel down when we perceive a lack of progress. What do you think you can do when those feelings arise?,T,Insignificant

That sounds like a great idea. How do you feel about sharing that with someone close to you?,T,Insignificant
I think I could tell my mentor about it.,P,Psychosocial History

I’d like to talk about my goals and maybe get some advice on managing my workload.,P,Psychosocial History

They’re usually really supportive and give good advice.,P,Psychosocial History
That’s fantastic. It sounds like you have a strong support system. How do you feel about leaning on that support when you’re feeling overwhelmed?,T,Insignificant
I think I should do that more often. I tend to keep things to myself.,P,Psychosocial History

I can send them a message and see if they’re free to chat.,P,Next Steps
