<sync>,P,Insignificant
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
so how are you doing today,T,Insignificant
i'm okay um,P,Insignificant
i'm a little,P,Insignificant
pensive i guess a little,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh down but,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
more or less okay,P,Insignificant
i'm sorry to hear that,T,Insignificant
where are you from originally,T,Insignificant
i was born in annapolis maryland,P,Psychosocial History
really,T,Insignificant
on the east coast,P,Psychosocial History
why did you move to l_a,T,Insignificant
originally i moved because i went to film school um,P,Psychosocial History
and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again,P,Psychosocial History
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a,T,Insignificant
it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but living,P,Insignificant
l_a is very has a very different kind of,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
how often do you go back to your hometown,T,Insignificant
uh not at all um,P,Psychosocial History
when i left things got things were sort of i,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
to be with,P,Insignificant
uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of,P,Insignificant
i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of,P,Psychosocial History
not really speaking to my family or old friends that often,P,Psychosocial History
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
it's not easy it's,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it's kind of um,P,Insignificant
i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um i miss um some friends um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um i feel like i failed,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable,P,Insignificant
um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy,P,Insignificant
so that doesn't really answer your question but,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
um [clears throat],P,Insignificant
i have certain,P,Insignificant
i do i do a lot of writing,P,Current Functional Status
um i have certain,P,Insignificant
music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can,P,Insignificant
when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of,P,Insignificant
happening really um,P,Insignificant
it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess,P,Current Functional Status
mhm,T,Insignificant
when was the last time that happened,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and when i was really,P,Insignificant
when i was really getting into writing it and um,P,Insignificant
it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed,P,Current Functional Status
cool,T,Insignificant
what was it about,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it was about a,P,Insignificant
guy who is searching for,P,Insignificant
something it's,P,Insignificant
it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he,P,Insignificant
that he,P,Insignificant
met and just,P,Insignificant
was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because,P,Insignificant
sort of uh it's sort of romantic,P,Insignificant
adventure comedy kind of thing,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um so i wrote some screenplays and uh,P,Insignificant
you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
just creative writing so,P,Insignificant
i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to,P,Insignificant
to really hit me,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
it's not easy the [exhale],P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
hate it because it's so difficult,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
good i don't i don't really have a temper i,P,Insignificant
it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people,P,Risk Assessment
um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can,P,Risk Assessment
lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much,P,Risk Assessment
try to it when i'm upset,P,Insignificant
i i get upset with myself not with other people,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
last night i guess well <weh> um,P,Insignificant
i got in an argument about whether or not,P,Insignificant
cleaning vegetables was necessary because of,P,Insignificant
i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay,P,Insignificant
so it turned into this,P,Insignificant
big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
i ended up being wrong on that one but,P,Insignificant
it is,P,Insignificant
yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
a lot so much um,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
i was in uh a relationship that i really really,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
that i really wanted to work,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i ended up and it was partly due to,P,Insignificant
i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
at like everything sort of spiraled out of,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i wasn't mean but i was,P,Insignificant
but i was getting more and more messed up,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so,P,Insignificant
that was pretty that was pretty tough,P,Insignificant
hmm,T,Insignificant
could you have done anything to avoid it,T,Insignificant
well some of it was was that,P,Insignificant
i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
completely kind of i mean i still get,P,Insignificant
i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i don't completely lose it for days at a time,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then,P,Insignificant
i would've i would i would be,P,Insignificant
i would be,P,Insignificant
it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have,P,Insignificant
i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
things being how they were,P,Insignificant
do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself,T,Insignificant
i mean it's,P,Insignificant
it's possible uh,P,Insignificant
i mean obviously,P,Insignificant
yeah because i mean that's what i do i i,P,Insignificant
take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until,P,Insignificant
until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
and it's like any little detail that comes up,P,Insignificant
i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still,P,Insignificant
i still get,P,Insignificant
i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
well it's it's not,P,Insignificant
easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by,P,Insignificant
by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way,P,Substance Use History
um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
that's good,T,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
um well like i said i do a lot of,P,Insignificant
you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost,P,Insignificant
be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely,P,Insignificant
um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be,P,Insignificant
you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just,P,Insignificant
keep my mind occupied during all of that,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
i just need i mean,P,Insignificant
i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
they're triggered by everything,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
pretty much anything that i that i see if i,P,Insignificant
if i,P,Insignificant
if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about,P,Insignificant
just,P,Insignificant
anything you know i can reach back and connect,P,Insignificant
to,P,Insignificant
to this it's really it's really,P,Insignificant
i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break,P,Insignificant
from it,P,Insignificant
that sucks,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i,P,Physiological Observations
awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally,P,Physiological Observations
you know don't,P,Insignificant
i don't know i never really needed much sleep so,P,Physiological Observations
it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep,P,Physiological Observations
like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work,P,Physiological Observations
um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly,P,Physiological Observations
you know i get up i toss and turn all night,P,Physiological Observations
you know and now,P,Insignificant
it's just,P,Insignificant
it's,P,Insignificant
yeah i don't sleep too great right now,P,Physiological Observations
mhm,T,Insignificant
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
pretty i mean,P,Insignificant
i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i,P,Insignificant
i usually just kind of power through it and just,P,Insignificant
i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel,P,Insignificant
bad,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how long ago were you diagnosed,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i think,P,Insignificant
about three three four years ago,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant
it was when i,P,Insignificant
i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
for,P,Insignificant
years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
this,P,Insignificant
situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately,P,Insignificant
it happened after everything uh went bad so,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel,P,Insignificant
it really makes me,P,Insignificant
angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm,P,Insignificant
that i had to that i i lost everything because,P,Insignificant
because of,P,Insignificant
chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control,P,Insignificant
and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't,P,Insignificant
it was it didn't help it didn't work until,P,Insignificant
until,P,Insignificant
you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but,P,Insignificant
it was a little it's a little late now,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it was either,P,Insignificant
i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different,P,Substance Use History
but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after,P,Insignificant
after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but it was at least,P,Insignificant
that and not,P,Insignificant
firing me,P,Insignificant
but but but yeah but so i got help but it was,P,Insignificant
but it wasn't soon enough,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
do you still go to therapy now,T,Insignificant
uh not,P,Insignificant
not as much as i should,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i go to a couple of,P,Insignificant
meetings,P,Substance Use History
i go to i go to a_a so that i can,P,Substance Use History
um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that,P,Substance Use History
um unfortunately you know being unemployed,P,Insignificant
my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing,P,Insignificant
somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really,P,Insignificant
very,P,Insignificant
i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so,P,Insignificant
it's basically to keep my medication coming,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
okay,T,Insignificant
and then there's you <laughter>,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
right,P,Insignificant
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy,T,Insignificant
well like i said i mean,P,Insignificant
just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now,P,Insignificant
um just saying stuff outloud is just,P,Insignificant
like getting getting this stuff out,P,Insignificant
trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense,P,Insignificant
that you can actually deal with,P,Insignificant
is a big step like,P,Insignificant
regardless of who,P,Insignificant
you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that,P,Insignificant
stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can,P,Insignificant
talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know better than i than i have been um i mean,P,Insignificant
it it sort of,P,Insignificant
it goes <g> it has its ups and downs,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um you know i'm applying for jobs,P,Current Functional Status
five six jobs,P,Current Functional Status
or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview,P,Current Functional Status
never even getting close to,P,Current Functional Status
to to being self sufficient again,P,Current Functional Status
um,P,Insignificant
it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control,P,Progress Evaluation
so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is,P,Insignificant
it just has its it's just its own own challenge,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
it can be tough to find a good job these days,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it was probably you know a couple years ago,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i i was,P,Insignificant
i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
is,P,Insignificant
everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
we were having fun together,P,Insignificant
and we went out and got a christmas tree,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just,P,Insignificant
feeling like a part of somebody's life,P,Insignificant
and feeling like a part of the bigger,P,Insignificant
the bigger life,P,Insignificant
that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel,P,Insignificant
you know for that instant i felt like,P,Insignificant
a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and,P,Insignificant
you know everything was going really well and,P,Insignificant
i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person,P,Insignificant
a normal happy person,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that,P,Insignificant
i don't know if i'll ever feel that again,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
probably the,P,Insignificant
probably this,P,Insignificant
educational <educary> educational series i did uh,P,Insignificant
an educational,P,Insignificant
uh video series i did for the national science foundation,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it was,P,Insignificant
it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and,P,Insignificant
you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um,P,Insignificant
and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to,P,Insignificant
the world,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
that sounds interesting,T,Insignificant
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um,P,Insignificant
it was it was a,P,Insignificant
we were trying to come up with,P,Insignificant
with new ideas uh,P,Insignificant
for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know,P,Insignificant
to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big,P,Insignificant
you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um,P,Insignificant
and there was a lot to it and so,P,Insignificant
it was probably the biggest,P,Insignificant
project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it,P,Insignificant
right that doesn't yeah,P,Insignificant
awesome,T,Insignificant
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i guess,P,Insignificant
<grunt>,P,Insignificant
i don't know <laughter> uh,P,Insignificant
i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i,P,Insignificant
i i i don't know,P,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
