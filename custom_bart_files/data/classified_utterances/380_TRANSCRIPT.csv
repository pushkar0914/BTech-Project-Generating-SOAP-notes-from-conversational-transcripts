i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot,T,Insignificant
i can't see your shoes actually,P,Insignificant
uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything,P,Psychosocial History
what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
i enjoy the chance to get to like see other,P,Insignificant
um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the,P,Insignificant
the specificity of my own,P,Insignificant
you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um,P,Insignificant
i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
uh okay um,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
putting me on the spot here ellie,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
let's see,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
well um i,P,Insignificant
it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess,P,Insignificant
one of the last trips i did was to um,P,Insignificant
i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw,P,Insignificant
but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole,P,Insignificant
like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally,P,Insignificant
it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um,P,Insignificant
unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so,P,Insignificant
so um,P,Insignificant
uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
it's a tough question um,P,Insignificant
one <on> um,P,Insignificant
<makes clicking sound with mouth>,P,Insignificant
i uh,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
come back to it,P,Insignificant
let's come back to that later,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
that's what i just said,P,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
film,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know,P,Insignificant
i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys,P,Insignificant
and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and,P,Insignificant
at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um,P,Insignificant
like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in,P,Insignificant
playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film,P,Insignificant
like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always,P,Insignificant
i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like,P,Insignificant
hmm,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and uh and i never,P,Insignificant
uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was,P,Insignificant
fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars,P,Insignificant
the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
i'm not really sure uh,P,Insignificant
yeah it's it's it's,P,Insignificant
um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
uh i've always been fascinated by like,P,Insignificant
how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general,P,Insignificant
are you still working in that,T,Insignificant
i am yes,P,Current Functional Status
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct,P,Insignificant
and uh put <pu> put together,P,Insignificant
and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make,P,Insignificant
movies,P,Insignificant
uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the,P,Insignificant
all the processes but,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
i guess the best parabole for that would be a director,P,Insignificant
directing,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
my,P,Insignificant
i guess um,P,Insignificant
it's funny you should ask ellie um,P,Insignificant
i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't,P,Psychosocial History
when away,P,Insignificant
like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like,P,Insignificant
i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like,P,Insignificant
of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like,P,Insignificant
um thinks positively about me,P,Insignificant
um so it's i have like a,P,Insignificant
a complicated relationship with my parents,P,Psychosocial History
i mean <mea> and my family in general,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
why,T,Insignificant
i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
or inhibited person maybe um,P,Insignificant
so i like to like,P,Insignificant
until,P,Insignificant
yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed,P,Substance Use History
so now i you know i have a glass of wine and,P,Substance Use History
maybe watch a movie,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um,P,Insignificant
if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like,P,Insignificant
then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might,P,Insignificant
go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like,P,Current Functional Status
you know competitive sports and hiking,P,Current Functional Status
yeah,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
pretty good,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
well i always like arguing um,P,Insignificant
i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um,P,Insignificant
but i don't,P,Insignificant
as long as my like,P,Insignificant
'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks,P,Insignificant
uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
one of my weaker points i would say,P,Insignificant
but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
when was the last time that happened,T,Insignificant
what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
the last time i had a heated debate,P,Insignificant
was um i had a heated debate about,P,Insignificant
uh the movie boogie nights,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about,P,Insignificant
'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the,P,Insignificant
like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie,P,Insignificant
why,T,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um,P,Insignificant
they have a certain uh they think that the,P,Insignificant
like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like,P,Insignificant
complexity of character within the movie,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
that somehow like,P,Insignificant
<sigh> um,P,Insignificant
what what were they saying they were saying like the movie,P,Insignificant
it like xxx it's like the end of an era,P,Insignificant
which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they,P,Insignificant
how they interact in the plot,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
kind of like,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
yeah i guess,P,Insignificant
i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's,P,Insignificant
the um,P,Insignificant
i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i,P,Insignificant
i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it,P,Insignificant
um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but,P,Insignificant
but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie,P,Insignificant
and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like,P,Insignificant
so in the movie django unchained,P,Insignificant
um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big,P,Insignificant
the,P,Insignificant
big purpose of the movie is,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh,P,Insignificant
who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he,P,Insignificant
was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django,P,Insignificant
or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not,P,Insignificant
sacrifice themself for someone else,P,Insignificant
hmm,T,Insignificant
um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
like who,P,Insignificant
uh like,P,Insignificant
she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that,P,Insignificant
altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist,P,Insignificant
um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself,P,Insignificant
um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like,P,Insignificant
every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um,P,Insignificant
purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
somewhat like yeah and it's it uh,P,Insignificant
so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um,P,Insignificant
i think of losing my temper as being more,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
like i just,P,Insignificant
so <s> i i would so <s>,P,Insignificant
revert to um ad hominem like attacks,P,Insignificant
uh but i i didn't like that's not um,P,Insignificant
maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like,P,Insignificant
well you're an idiot,P,Insignificant
you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
yeah i'm glad you understand,P,Insignificant
<deep breath>,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
not,P,Insignificant
stories um,P,Insignificant
like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so,P,Insignificant
hmm,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
the hardest decision i've ever had to make,P,Insignificant
oh geez,P,Insignificant
could it just be one of the hardest decisions,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
like choosing between two things that it's like,P,Insignificant
i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between,P,Insignificant
two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life,P,Insignificant
but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mhm,T,Insignificant
and uh but i had to do it,P,Insignificant
for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends,P,Insignificant
were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world,P,Insignificant
and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't,P,Insignificant
i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think,P,Insignificant
it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back,P,Insignificant
to new york within like a month or two,P,Insignificant
uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could,P,Insignificant
leave new york,P,Insignificant
i see,T,Insignificant
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
it was how hard was that,P,Insignificant
or how hard is,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
how hard was that,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it was hard,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
<laughter> um,P,Insignificant
it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like,P,Insignificant
isolating isolating <is>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
that had kind of gone extremely,P,Insignificant
badly,P,Insignificant
and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole,P,Insignificant
everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of,P,Insignificant
saw it at the time so i didn't like,P,Insignificant
you know just being socially isolated etcetera,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sucks,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
well recently it's been awful,P,Physiological Observations
um,P,Insignificant
i uh,P,Insignificant
i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours,P,Physiological Observations
um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams,P,Physiological Observations
but previous to that night,P,Insignificant
so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep,P,Physiological Observations
um because i was working on set and i would get back,P,Insignificant
and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um,P,Insignificant
too much riled up energy or something i i don't know,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
tired uh,P,Physiological Observations
very,P,Insignificant
not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning,P,Insignificant
and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so,P,Substance Use History
um,P,Insignificant
i guess,P,Insignificant
with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go,P,Insignificant
um without caffeine it's,P,Insignificant
i'm just i'm just quieter i guess,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
more introverted,P,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
since,P,Insignificant
like lately as in when,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
eh at the beginning where the,P,Insignificant
the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and the the push to,P,Insignificant
to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like,P,Insignificant
coming to terms with that um,P,Insignificant
and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
you you know <sigh> you know <sigh>,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no i just,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
nope,P,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
the last time i felt really happy,P,Insignificant
might have to reach back,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i think the last time i felt really happy,P,Insignificant
was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie,P,Insignificant
um co-wrote co-directed co-produced,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the,P,Insignificant
writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up,P,Insignificant
eat breakfast,P,Insignificant
bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative,P,Insignificant
full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and,P,Insignificant
and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like,P,Insignificant
just like,P,Insignificant
i felt like it yeah i guess that was the,P,Insignificant
the last time that was that was like,P,Insignificant
eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
it's too much else to do so,P,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
i would say that i'm very,P,Insignificant
accepting <acce> like,P,Insignificant
accepting of other people,P,Insignificant
and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
open <o> open <ope> like,P,Insignificant
excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and,P,Insignificant
yeah um,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i guess i wish i was less uh,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
everyday interactions and in my like,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
zest for for living,P,Insignificant
um <sigh> yeah i xxx,P,Insignificant
i other things i would change about myself i'd,P,Insignificant
i would,P,Insignificant
i don't know <laughter>,P,Insignificant
um,T,Insignificant
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
really badly about myself,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um,P,Insignificant
some sort of uh,P,Insignificant
conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always,P,Insignificant
always on the other side of the court you know like never,P,Insignificant
it was i i noticed,P,Insignificant
or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were,P,Insignificant
like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with,P,Insignificant
like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which,P,Insignificant
um i was like blamed or like you know,P,Insignificant
it was my it was my fault um when,P,Insignificant
when what i was doing like,P,Insignificant
yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like,P,Insignificant
there's no yeah i don't know,P,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
ten years ago um,P,Insignificant
stay stake you know like i i think that there's um,P,Insignificant
i have a tendency to,P,Insignificant
