Welcome back! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"I've been alright, a bit busy with work. You know how it is.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Absolutely, the freelance life can be quite hectic. Have you been able to implement any of the coping strategies we discussed last time, like yoga or taking peaceful walks?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I actually went for a walk in the park last weekend. It was nice to get some fresh air.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s wonderful to hear! How did it feel to be outdoors and away from your usual routine?,T,Insignificant
It felt refreshing. I didn’t realize how much I needed it until I was there.,P,Mental Health Observations
That’s a great insight. Being in nature can really help us reset. Did you notice any particular thoughts or feelings while you were walking?,T,Insignificant
"I felt a bit more at ease, but then I started thinking about all the work I had waiting for me.",P,Mental Health Observations
It’s common to have those thoughts creep in. How did you handle them?,T,Insignificant
I tried to remind myself that I could tackle my work after the walk. It helped a bit.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a positive approach! It sounds like you’re becoming more aware of your thoughts and how to manage them. Have you had any moments of feeling overwhelmed since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, a couple of times. I had a deadline, and I felt the pressure building up. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
How did you cope with that pressure?,T,Insignificant
"I just pushed through it. I stayed up late to finish, which I know isn’t the best way.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
"It’s understandable to want to meet deadlines, especially in a freelance setting. But it’s also important to find balance. How do you feel about setting boundaries around your work hours?",T,Insignificant
I think I need to do that. I often let work take over my evenings.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great realization. Perhaps we can explore some ways to create a more structured schedule for you. Would you be open to that?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
Definitely. I think it would help me feel less stressed.,P,Insignificant
"Excellent! We can brainstorm some strategies together. In the meantime, have you had any interactions with friends or family that stood out to you?",T,Insignificant
"I had dinner with my best friend last week. We talked about everything, and it felt good to connect.",P,Psychosocial History
That sounds lovely! How did that connection impact your mood?,T,Insignificant
It lifted my spirits. I always feel better after talking to him.,P,Mental Health Observations
Friendships can be such a valuable support system. Do you find yourself reaching out to him when you’re feeling down?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I do. He’s really good at listening.",P,Psychosocial History
That’s wonderful. It’s important to have someone like that in your life. Are there other friends you feel comfortable reaching out to as well?,T,Insignificant
"A couple, but not as much as him. I guess I should try to connect with them more often.",P,Psychosocial History
That could be beneficial. Building a broader support network can help you feel less isolated. What do you think holds you back from reaching out to those other friends?,T,Insignificant
I think I worry they might not have time to talk or that I’ll burden them with my problems.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s natural to feel that way, but often friends appreciate being asked. It can strengthen your relationships. Would you be willing to try reaching out to one of them this week?",T,Insignificant
I can try that. It might be good for me.,P,Next Steps
Great! Let’s check in on that next session. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?,T,Insignificant
I guess I’m just feeling a bit stuck creatively. I want to do more with my comedy but don’t know where to start.,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
That’s a valid concern. Creativity can sometimes feel elusive. What are some specific goals you have for your comedy right now?,T,Insignificant
I’d like to write more material and maybe perform at an open mic night.,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
Those sound like excellent goals! How about we set a small goal for you to write a certain amount of material this week? ,T,Next Steps
That sounds doable. Maybe I can aim for a few minutes of new content.,P,Next Steps
Perfect! Let’s aim for five minutes of new material. How does that sound?,T,Next Steps
I like that. It’s not overwhelming.,P,Next Steps
Exactly. Small steps can lead to bigger progress. I’m looking forward to hearing about it next time!,T,Insignificant
Thanks! I appreciate your support.,P,Insignificant
"Of course! Enjoy your week, and remember to take those peaceful walks. ",T,Insignificant
I will! See you next time.,P,Insignificant
