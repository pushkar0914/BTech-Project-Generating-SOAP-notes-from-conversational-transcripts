"Hi, it's Ellie again. It's great to see you back today. How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"Hi, Ellie. I've been okay, a bit anxious, to be honest. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I remember you mentioned feeling anxious about work and stability. Has anything specific triggered those feelings recently?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, I had a couple of shifts at the call center that were really tough. A lot of pressure from management, and I worry about my performance. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds stressful. Can you tell me more about what happened during those shifts?,T,Insignificant
"Well, there were a lot of calls, and I felt like I was juggling too many things at once. I ended up making a mistake on one of the calls, and I just felt terrible afterward.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Mistakes can feel overwhelming, especially in high-pressure environments. How did you cope with that feeling afterward?",T,Insignificant
"I tried to shake it off, but I kept replaying the situation in my head. I felt like I let everyone down.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s understandable to feel that way. It sounds like you’re being quite hard on yourself. What would you say to a friend in a similar situation?,T,Insignificant
I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it doesn’t define their worth. ,P,Insignificant
Exactly! It’s important to extend that same compassion to yourself. How might you apply that perspective to your own situation?,T,Insignificant
I guess I could remind myself that it’s just one call and that I usually do well at my job.,P,Insignificant
That’s a great insight! What do you think would help you manage those anxious feelings when they arise?,T,Insignificant
Maybe I could practice some mindfulness techniques or breathing exercises. ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds like a good plan. Have you tried any mindfulness techniques before?,T,Insignificant
I’ve read about them but haven’t really practiced. ,P,Insignificant
How about we explore a simple technique together? We can start with a breathing exercise. Would you be open to that?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, I’d like that.",P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four… hold it for a moment… and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do that a few times together.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
*breathes in and out* ,P,Insignificant
How do you feel after that?,T,Insignificant
"A bit calmer, actually. ",P,Mental Health Observations
That’s wonderful to hear! You can use this technique anytime you feel overwhelmed. ,T,Insignificant
I’ll definitely try to remember that. ,P,Insignificant
"Good! Now, let’s talk about your goals. You mentioned wanting to focus more on your singing and performing. Have you made any progress toward that?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve been looking for more local gigs, but they’re hard to come by. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It can be challenging to find opportunities in the performing arts. Have you thought about networking or connecting with other performers?,T,Insignificant
I haven’t really. I guess I could reach out to some people I know in the industry.,P,Next Steps
That could be a great way to open doors. Networking can lead to unexpected opportunities. ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, that makes sense. ",P,Insignificant
How do you feel about taking that step?,T,Insignificant
"A bit nervous, but I know it’s necessary. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Maybe we can set a small goal for you to reach out to one person this week?,T,Next Steps
That sounds manageable. I can do that.,P,Next Steps
Perfect! Let’s check in about it in our next session. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?,T,Insignificant
I think that covers it for now. ,P,Insignificant
"Alright, it’s been great talking with you. Remember, be kind to yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!",T,Insignificant
"Thank you, Ellie. See you next week!",P,Insignificant
Goodbye!,T,Insignificant
