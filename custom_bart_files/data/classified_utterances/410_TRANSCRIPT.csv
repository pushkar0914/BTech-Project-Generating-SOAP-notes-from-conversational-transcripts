so how are you doing today,T,Insignificant
uh i'm fine today today is my daughter's birthday,P,Insignificant
aw,T,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
where are you from originally,T,Insignificant
california,P,Psychosocial History

yes,P,Insignificant
what are some things you really like about l_a,T,Insignificant
um the beach,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
i love the waters,P,Psychosocial History
what are some things you don't really like about l_a,T,Insignificant
the gang violence,P,Trauma History
violence,P,Trauma History
okay,T,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
um i lost a lot of friends growing up in,P,Trauma History
um through elementary and high school,P,Trauma History
just losing them through gang violence,P,Trauma History
i'm sorry to hear that,T,Insignificant
yeah thank you,P,Insignificant
it was pretty tough out there <laughter>,P,Trauma History
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
haven't been to any place out of california yet so not really,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
um i'm an optician i'm a certified optician,P,Psychosocial History
and i also have my associate's degree,P,Psychosocial History
that sounds interesting,T,Insignificant
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um actually i went in,P,Insignificant
i didn't really know what i wanted to do when i first applied,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i just knew i wanted to change my life and do something successful,P,Psychosocial History
um before i settled down and you know had my daughter and everything,P,Psychosocial History
um actually my guidance counselor kind of helped me and i,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i always thought like they were so cool 'cause their white long lab coats,P,Psychosocial History
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
to be a optometrist,P,Psychosocial History
why,T,Insignificant
um 'cause i'm already an optician and that's like the first step,P,Psychosocial History
and um what i why is a good question it's because,P,Insignificant
then i would have a be able to have my own business,P,Psychosocial History
and i would have something successful to leave to my daughter,P,Psychosocial History
and she wouldn't have to really want to anything it would be like a,P,Insignificant
a family business but a a to help the community as well,P,Psychosocial History
and something i could leave for my daughter,P,Psychosocial History
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
tell me about your kids,T,Insignificant
uh my daughter she's five years old,P,Psychosocial History
uh she'll be starting elementary school next week,P,Psychosocial History
and today is her birthday uh five years ago i had her <laughter> um she is,P,Psychosocial History
very smart um i taught her home i home schooled her for five years and um,P,Psychosocial History
she's adorable she's my heart,P,Psychosocial History
do you find it easy to be a parent,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
this is like the hardest job ever <laughter>,P,Insignificant
what's the hardest thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
it's very hard,P,Insignificant
providing,P,Insignificant
providing uh making sure that,P,Insignificant
you wash their clothes um 'cause 'cause i mean it's hard enough,P,Insignificant
to be um a parent but i'm a young parent and,P,Psychosocial History
i'm a little more mature than her father so,P,Psychosocial History
it's um,P,Insignificant
it's it's the providing part i would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need it's so,P,Insignificant
complicated let alone um,P,Insignificant
it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um,P,Insignificant
even being here today i probably would've still been in bed but today is my daughter's party,P,Psychosocial History
and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i could make you know to,P,Psychosocial History
make sure that she has a good day so,P,Psychosocial History
it's all about uh going the extra mile,P,Insignificant
doing anything that you can do to provide <pro> to provide for them but it it's a very hard job,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's the best thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
that moment of the day,P,Insignificant
when your child tells you how much they care about you,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and,P,Psychosocial History
how many,P,Insignificant
i mean just call your name it just,P,Insignificant
it's a sense of reality um,P,Insignificant
to be called mom or to call call dad and,P,Insignificant
it it just like it infatuates you it also let you know like this is reality this is this is my life this is what i'm living right now and,P,Insignificant
it's a it's a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent,P,Psychosocial History
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
a lot of different things i'm actually,P,Psychosocial History
taking care of my daughter <laughter> um,P,Psychosocial History
i'm here with her uh,P,Psychosocial History
i was raised by my grandparents so,P,Psychosocial History
i mean i didn't really i didn't get to know my mom til i was sixteen and,P,Trauma History
my father i mean i couldn't point him out,P,Trauma History
on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is so,P,Trauma History
i feel that um,P,Insignificant
i'm very different from them because,P,Insignificant
no matter how hard the job is getting i don't give up,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i guess i,P,Insignificant
there's been <yawning> oh excuse me um there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive,P,Psychosocial History
in my life i can say,P,Insignificant
um my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field,P,Psychosocial History
she's in the uh she's an l_v_a,P,Psychosocial History
and um she's one of my older sisters,P,Psychosocial History
um i can say,P,Insignificant
me believing in god,P,Psychosocial History
being in my life god being in my life has,P,Psychosocial History
also kept my strong and to know that i don't have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
hm,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
i don't really look up to a lot of different people because,P,Insignificant
people lie so,P,Insignificant
and that's the most what i could think that's been positive for me,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
i think i'm outgoing <laughter> i used to be shy,P,Psychosocial History
um coming up as a kid and,P,Insignificant
i don't know i don't know what happened to me,P,Insignificant
uh one day i just broke out of my shell and,P,Psychosocial History
i've been um,P,Insignificant
very accurate of,P,Insignificant
showing my personality off <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
(laughter,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i actually like,P,Insignificant
for,P,Insignificant
the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach,P,Psychosocial History
and i like to just sit there,P,Psychosocial History
and just zone out everybody else that's there,P,Psychosocial History
and rub my toes in the sand,P,Psychosocial History
and that is so relaxing,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um <yawning>,P,Insignificant
excuse me sorry about that um,P,Insignificant
i learned not to uh 'cause it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or someone else's,P,Insignificant
and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper,P,Insignificant
is showing that i'm in charge of my life,P,Insignificant
so i don't even let stuff get to me,P,Insignificant
i don't even really remember the last time that i had to control my temper because that's how much i try to block out the,P,Insignificant
 the negativity,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
mm probably my husband <yawning>,P,Psychosocial History
my daughter's father um,P,Psychosocial History
uh probably over like uh you know the dishes or like the small things but not uh,P,Insignificant
physical altercation like with another human being no,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant

about how things like uh basically how things ended,P,Insignificant
um before my mom passed i wish that,P,Insignificant
i could've,P,Insignificant
helped her a little more,P,Insignificant
even though people tell me not to feel bad,P,Insignificant
um because she wasn't really there for me growing up,P,Trauma History
but i kind of feel guilty like you know,P,Insignificant
not being there as much as i could've been for her,P,Insignificant
before she passed away so,P,Insignificant
i think that's something that i um i still feel guilty for,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant

um,P,Insignificant

it was i felt kind of,P,Insignificant
robbed in a sense like i felt everyone else had parents and,P,Insignificant
i grew up with my grandparents and then,P,Insignificant
for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad,P,Insignificant
