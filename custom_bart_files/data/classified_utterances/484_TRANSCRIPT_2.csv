Hi there! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Hi! I’ve been okay, a bit stressed, but I did reach out to my dad like we discussed.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful! How did that go?,T,Insignificant
"It was a bit awkward at first, but we ended up having a nice conversation. I shared about school, and he seemed genuinely interested.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s great to hear! It sounds like you took a brave step. How did it feel to reconnect with him?,T,Insignificant
"It felt good! I was nervous, but I’m glad I did it. It made me realize I miss talking to him.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valuable insight. Do you think you’ll continue to reach out to him more regularly?,T,Insignificant
I hope so! I want to keep the lines of communication open.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a positive goal. Is there anything else on your mind related to family or relationships?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been thinking about my friendships too. I feel like I’m not as close to some of my friends as I used to be.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a common experience, especially during busy times. What do you think is contributing to that distance?",T,Insignificant
I think it’s just life getting in the way. Everyone is so busy with their own stuff.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That makes sense. Have you considered reaching out to them, similar to what you did with your dad?",T,Insignificant
I haven’t thought of that. I guess I could try!,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It might be worth it! You could suggest a casual hangout or even just check in with a message.,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I could invite them to grab coffee or something.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds like a great idea! How do you feel about taking that step?,T,Insignificant
"A little nervous, but I think it would be nice to reconnect.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s normal to feel nervous, but it can also be rewarding. How do you think your friends would respond?",T,Insignificant
I think they’d be happy to hear from me. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a positive outlook! It’s important to nurture those connections. Now, shifting gears a bit, how have your coping strategies been holding up with your stress?",T,Insignificant
"They’ve been helpful, but I still struggle sometimes. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s okay. It’s a journey. Are there specific situations where you feel your coping strategies aren’t working as well?,T,Insignificant
"When I have a lot of assignments due at once, I tend to feel overwhelmed and anxious.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s understandable. In those moments, would it help to break tasks down into smaller, manageable steps?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve heard that advice before, but I often forget to do it when I’m stressed.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It can be tough to remember when we’re in the thick of it. Would it help to set reminders for yourself?,T,Insignificant
That might work! I could set reminders on my phone to take breaks and reassess my tasks.,P,Next Steps
That’s a great idea! It can also help to schedule those breaks so you have something to look forward to.,T,Insignificant
I like that! I’ll try to plan short breaks in between my study sessions.,P,Next Steps
Excellent! Let’s also explore how you can incorporate mindfulness during those breaks. What do you think?,T,Insignificant
I think that could help me recharge. ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
You could try a quick meditation or even a few minutes of deep breathing to reset your mind.,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds good! I’ll give it a shot.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Wonderful! As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about the progress you’ve made since we started?",T,Insignificant
"I feel like I’ve made some good strides, especially with my family and coping strategies.",P,Progress Evaluation
