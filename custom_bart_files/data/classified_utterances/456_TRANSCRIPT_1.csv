"<sigh> hi, Ellie.",P,Insignificant
Hi! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"I've been okay, a bit up and down, but overall not too bad.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That's good to hear. You mentioned feeling more focused on your career. How has that been going for you?,T,Insignificant
"It's been a mixed bag, honestly. Some days I'm really productive, and other days I just feel stuck.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I understand that. What do you think contributes to those feelings of being stuck?,T,Insignificant
"I think it’s partly fear of failure. I put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed, and when I don't, it really gets to me.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds challenging. Can you tell me more about what success looks like for you?,T,Insignificant
"Success for me means getting my writing out there, maybe getting published, or landing a role that I really connect with. Just feeling like I'm making progress.",P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
Those are great goals. What steps have you been taking towards achieving them?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I’ve been trying to write every day, but some days I just can’t find the motivation. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like you have a routine in place. What do you think gets in the way of that motivation?,T,Insignificant
I think it’s a mix of self-doubt and distractions. Sometimes I just scroll mindlessly on my phone instead of writing.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s very common. Have you tried any strategies to manage those distractions?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried setting timers for writing sessions, but I struggle to stick to it when I’m not feeling inspired.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Inspiration can be fickle. What do you do when you feel inspired?,T,Insignificant
"When I feel inspired, I can write for hours. It’s like everything just flows out of me.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds wonderful! What do you think triggers that inspiration for you?,T,Insignificant
"I think being around other creative people helps, or sometimes just getting out of the house and experiencing new things.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great insight. Have you had any opportunities to do that recently?,T,Insignificant
"Not really. I’ve been a bit reclusive lately, just stuck in my routine.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It might be helpful to plan some outings or creative meetups. How does that sound?,T,Insignificant
That sounds good! I think I need that push to get out more.,P,Insignificant
What’s one place or event you’ve been wanting to check out?,T,Insignificant
There’s a local writer’s group that meets weekly. I’ve been meaning to join but haven’t yet.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Joining that group could be a great step towards connecting with others and gaining motivation. What’s holding you back from joining?,T,Insignificant
I guess I’m just nervous about meeting new people and sharing my work.,P,Risk Assessment
It’s completely normal to feel that way. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable?,T,Insignificant
Maybe if I just go to observe first without sharing anything. Just to get a feel for it.,P,Next Steps
That’s a smart approach. Observing can help ease the pressure. Would you like to set a goal to attend the next meeting?,T,Next Steps
"Yes, I think I can do that!",P,Next Steps
Great! Let’s also talk about how you can manage the self-doubt that creeps in. What thoughts do you typically have when you feel that way?,T,Insignificant
I often think that I’m not good enough or that my work isn’t worth sharing.,P,Risk Assessment
Those thoughts can be really tough. Have you ever challenged those thoughts?,T,Insignificant
Not really. I usually just let them linger.,P,Insignificant
"It might be helpful to practice reframing those thoughts. For example, instead of ""I'm not good enough,"" you could say, ""I am learning and growing as a writer."" How does that sound?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds like a good idea. I can try that.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Awesome! Let’s work on that together. If you catch yourself thinking negatively, try to write down the thought and then reframe it.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I can do that. I’ll keep a journal for it.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Perfect! Journaling can also help you track your progress and reflect on your feelings. How do you feel about that?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I think it’s a good idea. It’ll give me a chance to see how I’m improving over time.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Exactly! It can also serve as a reminder of your achievements, no matter how small. ",T,Insignificant
I like that. I often forget to celebrate the small wins.,P,Insignificant
Celebrating small wins is essential for building confidence. What’s a small win you’ve had recently?,T,Insignificant
I finished a short story I’d been working on for weeks. ,P,Progress Evaluation
That’s fantastic! How did it feel to complete it?,T,Insignificant
"It felt really good, like I accomplished something.",P,Progress Evaluation
Hold onto that feeling. It’s a reminder that you are capable of achieving your goals. ,T,Insignificant
"I will. Thank you, Ellie.",P,Insignificant
You’re welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. ,T,Insignificant
Me too. I’ll see you then!,P,Insignificant
Bye for now!,T,Insignificant
Bye!,P,Insignificant
