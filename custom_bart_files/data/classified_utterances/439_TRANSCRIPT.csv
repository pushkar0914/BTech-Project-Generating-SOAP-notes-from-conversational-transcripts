eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me,P,Psychosocial History
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
getting married and having my children <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
aw,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
tell me about your kids,T,Insignificant
i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not,P,Psychosocial History
and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson,P,Psychosocial History
and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner,P,Insignificant
and the other one is a computer engineer,P,Insignificant
so and i've been married for thirty three years,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
basically uh marriage pretty strong,P,Psychosocial History
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
do you find it easy to be a parent,T,Insignificant
you know what,P,Insignificant
if you build a foundation with your children,P,Insignificant
and have a good relationship with them,P,Insignificant
and talk to 'em and find out what's going on,P,Insignificant
and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you,P,Insignificant
and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you,P,Insignificant
you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door,P,Insignificant
that you care,P,Insignificant
and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out,P,Insignificant
um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem,P,Insignificant
as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble,P,Insignificant
and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
what's the best thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you,P,Psychosocial History
and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son,P,Psychosocial History
and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home,P,Psychosocial History
on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey,P,Psychosocial History
i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads,P,Psychosocial History
so it pays off,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
and i i basically he treats her well,P,Insignificant
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents,T,Insignificant
um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um,P,Insignificant
for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls,P,Psychosocial History
so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel,P,Psychosocial History
and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they,P,Insignificant
found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one,P,Psychosocial History
and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel,P,Psychosocial History
so i've made up for her,P,Insignificant
and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there,P,Psychosocial History
i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly,P,Psychosocial History
so i made up for it,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i think before i speak,P,Insignificant
and then i am the type of person also to um,P,Insignificant
i take on other people's feelings before i um,P,Insignificant
blurt out the wrong thing i try to,P,Insignificant
uh analyze the situation first,P,Insignificant
before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
<laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house,P,Psychosocial History
uh we had a disagreement on that um,P,Psychosocial History
men have their own way of doing things and um,P,Insignificant
i had told him not to use a certain uh,P,Insignificant
eh person to work on our house,P,Psychosocial History
but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead,P,Insignificant
and now he sees all the downfalls,P,Insignificant
and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so,P,Insignificant
but i guess he can tell by my facial expression,P,Insignificant
that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money,P,Insignificant
and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong,P,Insignificant
and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project,P,Insignificant
so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um,P,Insignificant
that i can think of that's recent,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me,P,Insignificant
and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um,P,Insignificant
you need to do your research,P,Insignificant
i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's,P,Insignificant
but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money,P,Insignificant
and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed,P,Insignificant
he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money,P,Insignificant
and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that sucks,T,Insignificant
it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and it didn't make any sense,P,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i retired early,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i had like thirty one and a half years of service,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant
i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um,P,Insignificant
i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i don't i pay very little money,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
let me see the hardest,P,Insignificant
it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying,P,Trauma History
and my mother um,P,Trauma History
died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma,P,Trauma History
and,P,Insignificant
i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying,P,Trauma History
or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me,P,Trauma History
and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx,P,Insignificant
and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order,P,Trauma History
and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things,P,Trauma History
you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and,P,Insignificant
i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff,P,Insignificant
and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting,P,Insignificant
she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had,P,Insignificant
a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything,P,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
yeah it was it was but,P,Insignificant
and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um,P,Insignificant
since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children,P,Psychosocial History
that my husband and i we got together,P,Insignificant
and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um,P,Insignificant
what do you call the um,P,Insignificant
barrel insurance we had that,P,Insignificant
and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything,P,Insignificant
and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird,P,Psychosocial History
so,P,Insignificant
my son,P,Insignificant
make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what,P,Insignificant
i went through,P,Insignificant
and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on,P,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust,P,Psychosocial History
i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
and that's it,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well,P,Physiological Observations
pretty good,P,Physiological Observations
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
exercise walk walking more so,P,Therapeutic Interventions
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
no not really,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh,P,Psychosocial History
uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them,P,Psychosocial History
uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um,P,Psychosocial History
thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing,P,Psychosocial History
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
oh uh resource person i've been um,P,Psychosocial History
described as a resource person from my supervisor,P,Psychosocial History
to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about,P,Psychosocial History
i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh,P,Psychosocial History
some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place,P,Psychosocial History
i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map,P,Psychosocial History
yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but,P,Psychosocial History
sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff,P,Psychosocial History
that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things,P,Psychosocial History
and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things,P,Psychosocial History
and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it,P,Psychosocial History
uh huh,T,Insignificant
and that gives me satisfaction,P,Psychosocial History
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i wish i can uh um,P,Insignificant
stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and,P,Physiological Observations
and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem,P,Physiological Observations
and if i can stop binging and making food my friend,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um,P,Psychosocial History
but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home,P,Psychosocial History
and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so,P,Insignificant
i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh,P,Psychosocial History
not happy with my weight that's it yeah,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry didn't hear you,P,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on,P,Psychosocial History
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um,P,Insignificant
putting away more money before i retire,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
instead of retiring too early,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
most proudest is of my life,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
meeting a lot of people that came in my life,P,Psychosocial History
uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school,P,Psychosocial History
and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together,P,Psychosocial History
lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school,P,Psychosocial History
group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion,P,Psychosocial History
and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh,P,Psychosocial History
