"Hi, it's Ellie again. I'm glad to see you today. How have you been since our last session?  ",T,Insignificant
"Hi, Ellie. I've been okay, I guess. Just trying to keep busy like we talked about.  ",P,Insignificant
That's good to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep since we last spoke?  ,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"A little bit, I think. I still struggle with sleep, but I had a few nights where I managed to get a decent amount.  ",P,Physiological Observations
That’s a positive step. What do you think contributed to those better nights?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I was just really tired from being out and about. I spent time with friends and just tried to stay active.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Staying active can definitely help. Did you find any particular activities that helped you feel more relaxed?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I went to a comedy show, and it was a lot of fun. Laughter really helps.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That's wonderful! Laughter can be a great stress reliever. Did you notice how you felt afterward?  ,T,Insignificant
"I felt lighter, like a weight was lifted. But then I crashed afterward and felt down again.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s common to feel that way after a high. What do you think causes that ""crash"" for you?  ",T,Insignificant
"I think it’s just the reality setting back in. Like, I have fun, but then I remember my worries.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. It sounds like a contrast between the joy of the moment and the stress of your everyday life.  ,T,Insignificant
Exactly. It’s frustrating.  ,P,Insignificant
Have you considered any coping strategies for when those feelings come back?  ,T,Insignificant
"Not really. I mean, I try to distract myself, but sometimes it feels like I’m just avoiding the problem.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Avoidance can be tempting, but it might help to process those feelings as they come. Would you be open to exploring that?  ",T,Insignificant
"Sure, I guess. What do you mean by processing?  ",P,Insignificant
"Processing involves acknowledging your feelings, understanding them, and finding ways to cope with them rather than just pushing them away.  ",T,Insignificant
"Okay, that sounds like it might be helpful.  ",P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s start by identifying a recent moment when you felt overwhelmed. Can you think of one?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, actually. A few days ago, I had a really bad day. I felt anxious all day, and it just spiraled.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What triggered that anxiety for you?  ,T,Insignificant
"I was just thinking about my future and how uncertain everything feels, especially with acting.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. The uncertainty of pursuing a passion can be quite stressful. How did you cope with that anxiety?  ,T,Insignificant
I ended up just isolating myself. I didn’t want to talk to anyone.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Isolation can sometimes feel like a safe option, but it can also intensify feelings of loneliness and anxiety. How did you feel afterward?  ",T,Insignificant
"I felt worse, honestly. I regretted not reaching out to my boyfriend.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s important to have support during tough times. Would you be willing to try reaching out next time you feel that way?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I could do that. He’s really understanding.  ",P,Insignificant
That’s great to hear. Supportive relationships can really help us cope. What else do you think might help when you start feeling anxious?  ,T,Insignificant
Maybe I could try writing down my feelings or something.  ,P,Next Steps
Writing can be a powerful tool for processing emotions. Would you be willing to commit to journaling when you feel overwhelmed?  ,T,Next Steps

Excellent! Let’s also talk about mindfulness. Have you ever practiced mindfulness or meditation?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve heard of it, but I’ve never really tried it.  ",P,Insignificant
Mindfulness can help ground you in the present moment and reduce anxiety. Would you like to try a simple exercise with me?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
