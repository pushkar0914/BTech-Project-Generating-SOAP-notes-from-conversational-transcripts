<sigh>  ,P,Insignificant
Hi again! It's great to see you. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"Um, I've been okay, I guess. Just trying to keep up with school and everything.  ",P,Psychosocial History
That sounds like a lot. Have you had any challenges with your studies?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I feel really overwhelmed sometimes. Like, I’m not sure if I’m cut out for this.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What specifically makes you feel overwhelmed?  ,T,Insignificant
I think it's just the amount of work and trying to balance everything else in my life.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. Have you found any strategies that help you manage your workload?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried making to-do lists, but I still feel like I’m not getting enough done.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
To-do lists can be helpful. Maybe we can explore breaking down your tasks into smaller steps?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, that might help. I just feel like I have so much to do all at once.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s understandable to feel that way. Sometimes, prioritizing tasks can ease that stress.  ",T,Insignificant
"Right, but I struggle with knowing what to prioritize.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
How about we try an exercise? We can list out your tasks and categorize them by urgency and importance.  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, that sounds good.  ",P,Insignificant
Great! What tasks do you have on your plate right now?  ,T,Insignificant
"Well, I have a paper due next week, a midterm coming up, and I have to study for my finals.  ",P,Current Functional Status
Let’s write those down. Which one feels the most urgent to you?  ,T,Insignificant
"The paper, I guess.  ",P,Current Functional Status
"Okay, so we can focus on that first. What’s the next task?  ",T,Insignificant
"The midterm, I think.  ",P,Current Functional Status
"And finally, studying for finals. How does that feel?  ",T,Insignificant
It feels a bit better to see it laid out like this.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I’m glad to hear that. Now, let’s think about how you can tackle the paper. What are the steps you need to take?  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Um, I need to research, outline, and then write it.  ",P,Current Functional Status
Perfect! Let’s set a timeline for each step. How much time do you think you need for research?  ,T,Insignificant
Maybe two days?  ,P,Current Functional Status
Sounds reasonable. How about we set aside specific times for that?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I can do that.  ",P,Insignificant
"Excellent! After research, how long do you think outlining will take?  ",T,Insignificant
Probably a day.  ,P,Current Functional Status
"Great. Now, what about writing the paper?  ",T,Insignificant
I think I’ll need at least three days to write it.  ,P,Current Functional Status
That’s a solid plan. Would you like to set specific goals for each day?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, that would help keep me on track.  ",P,Insignificant
"Perfect! Let’s summarize your timeline: two days for research, one day for outlining, and three days for writing.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yes, I like that.  ",P,Insignificant
How does that make you feel about the paper?  ,T,Insignificant
"A little less anxious, honestly.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s okay to take breaks too.  ",T,Insignificant
"Right, I tend to forget that.  ",P,Insignificant
Taking breaks can help recharge your mind. What do you like to do during breaks?  ,T,Insignificant
I usually go for a walk or watch a show.  ,P,Psychosocial History
Those sound like great ways to relax. How about incorporating those into your study schedule?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I’ll try to do that.  ",P,Insignificant
Do you feel like you have a good support system for your studies?  ,T,Insignificant
"I do have friends, but I don’t always reach out when I need help.  ",P,Psychosocial History
What holds you back from reaching out?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I don’t want to burden them with my problems.  ,P,Psychosocial History
"It’s understandable to feel that way, but friends often want to help. Would you consider sharing your feelings with them?  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
Maybe. I just don’t want to seem weak.  ,P,Psychosocial History
Seeking support doesn’t show weakness; it shows strength. It’s okay to lean on others.  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s true. I’ll think about it.  ,P,Insignificant
Good! How have you been feeling physically?  ,T,Insignificant
"I still feel pretty tired, honestly.  ",P,Physiological Observations
Have you been able to address your sleep issues?  ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I’m still trying to figure it out with my doctor.  ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
That’s a good step. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed?  ,T,Insignificant
"No, I haven’t. What do you suggest?  ",P,Insignificant
Mindfulness or deep breathing can be helpful. Would you like to try a brief exercise?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, I can try that.  ",P,Insignificant
Let’s take a few deep breaths together. Inhale deeply… and exhale slowly.  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
<inhales and exhales>  ,P,Insignificant
How does that feel?  ,T,Insignificant
"It feels nice, actually.  ",P,Physiological Observations
I’m glad to hear that. You can use this technique whenever you feel stressed.  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I’ll definitely keep that in mind.  ,P,Insignificant
"Great! As we wrap up, what is one goal you’d like to focus on before our next session?  ",T,Insignificant
I think I want to stick to my study plan for the paper.  ,P,Current Functional Status
That sounds like a solid goal. Let’s check in on that next time.  ,T,Next Steps
"Okay, I can do that.  ",P,Insignificant
