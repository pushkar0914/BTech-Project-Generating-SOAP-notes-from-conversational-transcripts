Hi again! It's great to see you. How have you been since our last session? ,T,Insignificant
"Um, okay, I guess. ",P,Insignificant
Just okay? Anything in particular on your mind? ,T,Insignificant
"Just the same stuff, you know, work and money. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I understand. Have you had a chance to reflect more on our conversation about your job situation? ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I've been thinking about it. ",P,Insignificant
What thoughts have come up for you? ,T,Insignificant
"Well, I still feel stuck. I want to find something better, but I don’t know where to start. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common feeling. What kind of job would you ideally like to pursue? ,T,Insignificant
"I want to be a personal trainer, but I also want to get into real estate. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Have you taken any steps toward that? ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I’m just busy with my current job. ,P,Current Functional Status
It sounds like time is a big barrier for you. Would it help to break it down into smaller steps? ,T,Insignificant
Maybe. ,P,Insignificant
What if we set a small goal for this week? Something you could do that would get you closer to those dreams? ,T,Insignificant
Like what? ,P,Insignificant
Perhaps researching personal training certifications or real estate courses? ,T,Next Steps
That sounds doable. ,P,Insignificant
Great! How about we check in on that next session? ,T,Insignificant
Sure. ,P,Insignificant
How have you been managing your stress lately? ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been working out more, which helps. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI): Physiological Observations
That’s excellent! Exercise is a great way to relieve stress. Do you find it helps your mood? ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, it does. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI): Physiological Observations
Have you noticed any changes in your sleep since we last talked? ,T,Insignificant
"A little better, but still not great. ",P,Physiological Observations
What do you think is affecting your sleep? ,T,Insignificant
I think it’s just my mind racing about work and money. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed? ,T,Insignificant
Not really. ,P,Insignificant
Would you be open to trying some mindfulness exercises? ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I guess I could try. ,P,Insignificant
Mindfulness can help you calm your mind. How about starting with just five minutes of deep breathing each night? ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I can do that. ,P,Insignificant
Awesome! Let’s make that another goal for this week. ,T,Next Steps
Okay. ,P,Insignificant
You mentioned feeling guilty about your financial stability. Can you elaborate on that? ,T,Insignificant
It just feels like I’m always struggling to keep up. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds really tough. Have you thought about creating a budget? ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried, but it’s hard to stick to it. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I understand. What do you think makes it hard to stick to a budget? ,T,Insignificant
I guess I don’t always have control over my spending. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a valid concern. Would you be open to setting small spending limits for certain categories? ,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I could try that. ",P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s aim for one category this week. How about dining out? ,T,Next Steps
That sounds reasonable. ,P,Insignificant
How do you feel about your relationships with friends and family? ,T,Insignificant
They’re good. I’ve been hanging out with friends more. ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s wonderful! Social support is so important. Have you talked to them about your job struggles? ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I don’t want to burden them. ,P,Psychosocial History
"It’s understandable to feel that way, but sometimes sharing can help lighten the load. ",T,Insignificant
Maybe. ,P,Insignificant
How do you think they would respond if you opened up? ,T,Insignificant
They’d probably be supportive. ,P,Psychosocial History
Would you consider reaching out to one friend this week to share how you’ve been feeling? ,T,Next Steps
I might. ,P,Insignificant
That sounds like a good step. ,T,Insignificant
Yeah. ,P,Insignificant
"As we wrap up, what are the three main goals you want to focus on for next week? ",T,Insignificant
"Research personal training, try mindfulness breathing, and set a dining out budget. ",P,Next Steps

Me too. ,P,Insignificant

Bye. ,P,Insignificant
