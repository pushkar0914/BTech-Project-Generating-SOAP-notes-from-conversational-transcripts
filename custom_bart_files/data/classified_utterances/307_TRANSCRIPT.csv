um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college,P,Psychosocial History
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a,T,Insignificant
 uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that's good,T,Insignificant
how do you like your living situation,T,Insignificant
it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between,P,Psychosocial History
[laughter],T,Insignificant
the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
how do you know them,T,Insignificant
one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist,P,Psychosocial History
how close are you to them,T,Insignificant
it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um,P,Psychosocial History
i guess pretty close,P,Psychosocial History
right now we're kinda distant,P,Psychosocial History
aww,T,Insignificant
tell me more about that,T,Insignificant
oh about the distant,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks,P,Psychosocial History
'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room,P,Risk Assessment
uh oh,T,Insignificant
and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of,P,Psychosocial History
we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move ,P,Insignificant
yeah that sucks,T,Insignificant
it's okay it'll get better,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
it depends with whom ,P,Insignificant
i'm,P,Insignificant
dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
why,T,Insignificant
oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter],P,Insignificant
[laughter],T,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
uh probably my best friend nicole,P,Psychosocial History
she's probably been we've been best friends for like,P,Psychosocial History
god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah,P,Psychosocial History
wow,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
can you give me an example of that,T,Insignificant
of,P,Insignificant
of what ,P,Insignificant
how do you know them,T,Insignificant
uh my friend nicole,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
um we met in french class freshman year of high school,P,Psychosocial History
we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then,P,Psychosocial History
nice,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
what are some things you like to do for fun,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking,P,Psychosocial History
staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
just hanging out with friends i guess,P,Psychosocial History
whatever,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how close are you to your family,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um,P,Psychosocial History
those kinds of,P,Insignificant
things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things,P,Psychosocial History
 i don't really discuss that with them,P,Psychosocial History
mm,T,Insignificant
so i guess superficially close,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess,P,Psychosocial History
that's good,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
what are some things that make you really mad,T,Insignificant
uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again,P,Insignificant
i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter],P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
 when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
uh yesterday,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and so and,P,Insignificant
so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
[laughter],T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
do you feel that way often,T,Insignificant
about other people or about myself or angry,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Insignificant
xxxx [laughter],P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
dang it,P,Insignificant
that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me,P,Insignificant
um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
 my dream job,P,Insignificant
i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end,P,Insignificant
i guess it's something that i realized,P,Insignificant
i like to see,P,Insignificant
the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography,P,Psychosocial History
i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something,P,Psychosocial History
in that,P,Insignificant
realm i guess,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
do you travel a lot,T,Insignificant
i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to,P,Psychosocial History
gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries,P,Psychosocial History
wow,T,Insignificant
i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot,P,Psychosocial History
what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and,P,Psychosocial History
see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to,P,Psychosocial History
stir things up,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
oh gosh okay um,P,Insignificant
i'm trying to think,P,Insignificant
one of my trips,P,Insignificant
i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is,P,Psychosocial History
one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon,P,Psychosocial History
oh my gosh,T,Insignificant
i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places,P,Psychosocial History
i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made,P,Psychosocial History
and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like,P,Psychosocial History
white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful,P,Psychosocial History
or something that's different too,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
cool,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
pretty easy as long as I,P,Physiological Observations
get well no i always sleep so easy,P,Physiological Observations
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world,P,Physiological Observations
do you feel that way often,T,Insignificant
i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of ,P,Physiological Observations
energizing me so no it's not too bad,P,Physiological Observations
that's good,P,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so,P,Insignificant
it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
it can be tough to find a good job these days,T,Insignificant
yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mhm,T,Insignificant
so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like,P,Insignificant
when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know,P,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so,P,Insignificant
but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh,P,Psychosocial History
all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
do you feel down,T,Insignificant
uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter],P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
nice,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm just trying to find like what,P,Insignificant
i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
it's all good,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
uh no i don't think so but i mean,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
nope,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you ever served in the military,T,Insignificant
nope,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
okay,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
oh let's see,P,Insignificant
uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail,P,Insignificant
'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home,P,Insignificant
so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
ten years ago,P,Insignificant
like what,T,Insignificant
well that would've made me like twelve so,P,Insignificant
 [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act,P,Psychosocial History
i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time,P,Psychosocial History
and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes ,P,Insignificant
um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just,P,Insignificant
expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder,P,Insignificant
kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good,P,Insignificant
i don't try to go above that,P,Insignificant
if that makes any sense,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v,P,Psychosocial History
[laughter],P,Insignificant
but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap,P,Psychosocial History
or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences ,T,Insignificant
[laughter],P,Insignificant
that's a tough question,P,Insignificant
um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east,P,Psychosocial History
and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
aww,T,Insignificant
and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in,P,Insignificant
and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mhm,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well,P,Insignificant
and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not,P,Insignificant
um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy,P,Psychosocial History
that's probably one,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter],P,Psychosocial History
awesome,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
bubbly ,P,Psychosocial History
fun ,P,Psychosocial History
maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um,P,Psychosocial History
[laughter],T,Insignificant
probably ,P,Insignificant
 uh definitely friendly,P,Psychosocial History
um and pretty like a positive person,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
but sometimes maybe a little bit,P,Insignificant
aggressive but,P,Insignificant
for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter],P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
huh ,P,Insignificant
really happy,P,Insignificant
oh when i was in mexico,P,Insignificant
over winter well,P,Insignificant

san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun,P,Psychosocial History
that was a good time,P,Insignificant
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
yeah it was cool,P,Insignificant
okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
[laughter] bye,P,Insignificant
