and um,P,Insignificant
that was my second time being there,P,Psychosocial History
and,P,Insignificant
i enjoyed it more this time,P,Psychosocial History
because,P,Insignificant
um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um,P,Insignificant
and i was better prepared,P,Psychosocial History
for,P,Insignificant
italians and their culture i felt,P,Insignificant
i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought,P,Insignificant
for that trip,P,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
um <clears throat>,P,Insignificant
that would be,P,Insignificant
um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house,P,Psychosocial History
in the midst of,P,Insignificant
acres and acres and acres of grapes was just,P,Insignificant
magnificent,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
um human development,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i,P,Insignificant
started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and um i went to a program,P,Insignificant
in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and um so the college offered,P,Insignificant
human development as a major,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i um,P,Insignificant
just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
towards that particular major and,P,Insignificant
and i'm happy with it,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
are you still working in that,T,Insignificant

children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children,P,Psychosocial History
seventeen and twenty three,P,Psychosocial History
do you find it easy to be a parent,T,Insignificant
no,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
what's the best thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional,P,Psychosocial History
what's the hardest thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time,P,Psychosocial History
for every age <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages,P,Psychosocial History
like what,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents,T,Insignificant
um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages,P,Psychosocial History
that's why it makes me crazy,P,Insignificant
um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents,P,Insignificant
it was just kinda like,P,Insignificant
you know is she fed is she dressed,P,Insignificant
she has a house i mean a roof over her head,P,Insignificant
and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so,P,Insignificant
it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of,P,Insignificant
that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age,P,Insignificant
every year month,P,Insignificant
you know <clears throat> and um,P,Insignificant
so i think it difference differs in that way,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
tremendously,P,Insignificant
how close are you to your family,T,Insignificant
very close,P,Psychosocial History
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
outgoing,P,Psychosocial History
why,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
feel a little,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
confident to talk to people,P,Psychosocial History
i probably talk,P,Insignificant
more than i need to <laughter>,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
um <clears throat> i bead,P,Psychosocial History
i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i'm pretty good i i,P,Insignificant
well i think i um,P,Insignificant
try not to,P,Insignificant
not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are,P,Risk Assessment
when i'm upset,P,Risk Assessment
um which is not good,P,Insignificant
'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out,P,Risk Assessment
and um,P,Insignificant
yeah that,P,Insignificant
that's uh something i have to work on,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
like exercising or something,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
on him,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
uh really tired of talking about that same topic,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well it came it spawned from <f> from,P,Insignificant
a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for,P,Insignificant
many things,P,Insignificant
and um <clears throat>,P,Insignificant
and so he took that information and came home,P,Insignificant
and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me,P,Insignificant
think about cheating and,P,Insignificant
he knows that i've been resentful of him,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating,P,Insignificant
<clears throat> and um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
i we've had this conversation a lot of times,P,Insignificant
and uh i mean not just that but,P,Insignificant
i don't know just about cheating in general,P,Insignificant
and um so i just said what i,P,Insignificant
normally said normally say is that i haven't,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
cheated and that i,P,Insignificant
did think about that when we were first together,P,Insignificant
and uh but it was just a mere thought,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another,P,Insignificant
and that just kinda,P,Insignificant
<sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again,P,Insignificant
and why are we having this conversation <laughter>,P,Insignificant
are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that,P,Insignificant
that,P,Insignificant
went into,P,Insignificant
that um,P,Insignificant
argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting,P,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
not talking,P,Insignificant
at all <laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
because i really don't like,P,Insignificant
if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
um i was yelled at,P,Trauma History
a lot,P,Trauma History
and i just,P,Insignificant
feel bad about that and i,P,Insignificant
try really hard to not,P,Insignificant
handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get,P,Insignificant
and result in in yelling,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
that would probably be whether to keep,P,Insignificant
a pregnancy or not,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
yeah i um,P,Insignificant
i was just talking about it yesterday actually,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
oh i was pregnant and,P,Insignificant
i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married,P,Insignificant
and but i just,P,Insignificant
didn't think that i it was the right time for me,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
i had,P,Insignificant
pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
but i made the decision by myself,P,Insignificant
and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant,P,Insignificant
he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me,P,Insignificant
and so that decision was quite hard,P,Insignificant
because i felt obligated to do so,P,Insignificant
and felt super guilty to not,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
<drops microphone> oops,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
this is on correctly um,P,Insignificant
hang on this ear piece is falling,P,Insignificant
there we go,P,Insignificant
that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no,P,Insignificant
i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make,P,Insignificant
in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um,P,Insignificant
the hospital should um unplug the life,P,Insignificant
or um life support machine for my father,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
or not,P,Insignificant
that was the hardest decision,P,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
and to have been um,P,Insignificant
to resort to the situation that he was in,P,Insignificant
not capable of doing anything at all either speaking,P,Insignificant
for himself um,P,Insignificant
was beyond it,P,Insignificant
who he was and i just couldn't see him,P,Insignificant
like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told,P,Insignificant
so i agreed,P,Insignificant
to um resort that,P,Insignificant
i'm sorry to hear that,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
not,P,Physiological Observations
hardly ever,P,Physiological Observations
why,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
too many things running on my mind um,P,Physiological Observations
and pretty much um,P,Insignificant
mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends,P,Physiological Observations
uh even though i,P,Insignificant
know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about,P,Insignificant
uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time,P,Physiological Observations
but um,P,Insignificant
and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out,P,Physiological Observations
but it's hard,P,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
very stressed,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint

mm my son is is um,P,Insignificant
has been,P,Insignificant
uh in dealing with some legal issues,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint

it's been really hard,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
yes i've been probably very short,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
moody irritable,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter>,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
my mind just goes from one,P,Insignificant
point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there,P,Insignificant
um you know,P,Insignificant

i uh,P,Insignificant
see a psychiatrist,P,Medical and Psychiatric History

yes,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy,T,Insignificant
well um,P,Insignificant
i've,P,Insignificant
in the process of changing therapists so it's been about,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
because the program that i was in,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
lost funding,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i lost my therapist,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been,P,Insignificant
about two months,P,Insignificant
maybe three now,P,Insignificant
and um but i did notice when i was in therapy,P,Insignificant
um that it was just an intricate part of my,P,Insignificant
my life my week to,P,Insignificant
see my therapist,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it really helped me,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
cope,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant

um,P,Insignificant
<sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um,P,Insignificant
when he was released,P,Insignificant
from um,P,Insignificant
jail,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning,P,Psychosocial History
that i'll,P,Insignificant
i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to,P,Insignificant
do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know,P,Psychosocial History
legally of course,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
outgoing,P,Psychosocial History

sensitive,P,Psychosocial History
loyal,P,Psychosocial History

um,P,Insignificant
just <j> just the little things that,P,Insignificant
used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself,P,Insignificant
doing them and it bothers me a lot,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint

regarding what,P,Insignificant

to go to college right after high school,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
and not wait,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
and <sigh>,P,Insignificant
that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
