History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing pretty well. I tried to practice my patience with my family, and it went better than I expected. Sure! Last weekend, my dad started asking me about my job again, and instead of snapping, I took a deep breath and explained things calmly. I felt proud of myself. It was nice to have a calm conversation instead of an argument. It was actually fun! I felt a little anxious at first, but once I started talking, it got easier."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Those feelings are quite common. We can work on cognitive restructuring to challenge those thoughts. For example, when you think, “They won’t like me,” we can reframe it to, “I’m open to making connections, and not everyone has to like me.” That sounds helpful. I definitely need to work on changing those negative thoughts. It’s great that you’ve maintained the routine! We can also explore some guided imagery techniques to help calm your mind before sleep. Would you like to try that? Yes, I think that could help."
Next Steps,"Wonderful! As we wrap up today, let’s set a goal for the coming week. You could aim to practice the cognitive restructuring technique and the guided imagery before bed. I can do that! "
