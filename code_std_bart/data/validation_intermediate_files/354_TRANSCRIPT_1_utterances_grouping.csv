History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s understandable. Last time, you mentioned feeling under pressure. Have those feelings changed at all? A little bit, I guess. I still feel stressed about work and school, but I’m managing it better. That’s good to hear. Can you share what strategies you’ve been using to manage that stress? I’ve been trying to stick to a schedule and make sure I have some time for myself, like working out or listening to music. That sounds like a solid plan. How has sticking to a schedule helped you? It helps me feel more organized. When I have a plan, I feel less overwhelmed. Excellent! Structure can be really beneficial. Have you found any particular times of day that are more stressful for you? Yeah, mornings are tough. I feel rushed to get everything done before work. Mornings can be hectic. Have you considered any techniques to ease your morning routine? I’ve thought about waking up a little earlier to give myself more time. That’s a great idea! Allowing yourself extra time can really set a positive tone for the day. How do you think you’ll feel if you try that? I think I’d feel less anxious and more prepared. That sounds promising. Let’s explore how you can implement that change. What time do you usually wake up? Great! Now, last time you mentioned that not playing football for a while has affected your mood. Have you had any opportunities to play recently? Not really. I’ve been too busy. I miss it a lot. Awesome. Let’s talk about your parenting. You mentioned it can be challenging. Have there been any recent moments with your son that made you feel proud? Yes! He learned to ride his bike without training wheels. I was really proud of him. That’s wonderful! How did you support him during that process? I encouraged him a lot, told him he could do it. I think that helped. Encouragement is so important! How did that experience make you feel as a parent? It felt good. I love seeing him succeed. That’s a wonderful commitment. Let’s also revisit the topic of sleep. You mentioned that getting a good night’s sleep is hard for you. Have you noticed any changes since our last session? Not really. I still struggle to fall asleep. Have you tried any techniques to help you wind down before bed? I’ve tried reading, but I usually end up falling asleep with the book in my hands."

Next Steps,"That sounds like a wonderful way to start your day! How do you feel about trying that this week? I’m willing to give it a shot. Missing something you enjoy can definitely impact your mood. Would you be open to scheduling some time to play or practice, even if it’s just for a short period? Yeah, I think that would help. I need to find a way to fit it into my schedule. That’s a positive step. Perhaps you could set aside a specific time each week dedicated to football. How does that sound? That sounds good. I’ll try to make it work. That’s beautiful. It sounds like you’re doing a great job supporting him. What are some other ways you can encourage him in the future? I could help him with his homework more. He struggles sometimes. That’s a great idea! Being involved in his education can really boost his confidence. How do you feel about being more present in that area? I think it’s important. I want him to do well. That’s a common challenge! How about establishing a specific bedtime routine? Something relaxing you can do consistently before bed? I could try that. Maybe some light stretching or listening to calming music. That sounds perfect! Consistency can help signal to your body that it’s time to wind down. Would you be willing to try that this week? Yes, I’ll give it a shot."
