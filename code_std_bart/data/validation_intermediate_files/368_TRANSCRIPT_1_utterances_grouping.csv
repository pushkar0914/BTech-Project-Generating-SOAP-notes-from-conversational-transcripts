Trauma History,Nothing reported
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed last time. Have those feelings changed at all? A little. I mean, I’m still worried about my mom, but I’ve been trying to focus more on my workouts and guitar. It helps to distract me. Not really. I went to visit, but she was asleep. I just... I don’t know. It’s hard seeing her like that. I’m not sure. I guess talking about it helps, but I don’t want to dwell on it too much. I just want to be happy again. I think it would be just feeling content, you know? Like, being able to enjoy the little things without all this stress hanging over me. I just feel like I’m sending out applications into a black hole. I hardly get any responses. I haven’t really thought about it. I just keep applying to the same types of jobs, hoping something will stick."

Therapeutic Interventions,I understand. It’s a delicate balance. Would you be open to trying a small exercise for our next session where you share your feelings with her?
Next Steps,"Sure, I can try that. It’ll be hard, but I’ll give it a shot. It’s understandable. Maybe you could start with a casual conversation to ease into it. Would you like to set a goal for that before our next session? Yeah, that sounds good. I can try to reach out to one person. Maybe I could set a smaller goal, like just going for a short walk instead of a full run. Yeah, I can do that. I think I’ll try to remember that."
