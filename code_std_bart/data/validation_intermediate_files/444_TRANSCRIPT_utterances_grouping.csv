Medical and Psychiatric History,philosophy i have my degree in philosophy i minored in art well i started out in business and i got very disenchanted with it very quickly and so i decided to study what i wanted to study while i was in college and had the opportunity so that's what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher um but i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school and being a professor of ethics um but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how i ended up joining the peace corps <laughter> so it all worked out um writing i've done a few um uh scripts uh some screeenplays with a friend of mine um but i don't really wanna do the hollywood thing um <tisk> but writing and teaching and traveling if i could do that overseas no no i procrastinate a lot um i start projects and i don't finish them uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get almost finished i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree but instead i got pregnant and got married and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time where i had to fight for a directorship and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship and so i really wish so i resigned and i wish i had stuck with that 'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses my ego got in the way
