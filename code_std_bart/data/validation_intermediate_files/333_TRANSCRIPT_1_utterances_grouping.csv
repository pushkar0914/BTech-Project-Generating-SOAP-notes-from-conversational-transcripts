History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been a bit of a mixed bag. Some days I feel really inspired, and others, it’s hard to get started. I think it’s mostly my mood. If I’m feeling a bit down or anxious about other things, it’s harder to focus on writing. Yes, actually. I had some unexpected expenses that threw me off a bit.  I’ve been using guided meditations, which help me focus. But sometimes my mind wanders, and I get frustrated. I guess I’m still thinking about those opportunities I mentioned last session. I keep wondering if I should have pursued them."

Next Steps,"That’s wonderful to hear. Perhaps incorporating more walks or nature time could be beneficial for you. Would you be open to setting a goal for this week to spend time in nature? Yes, I’d like that! Maybe I can aim for at least two walks. Good! This week, perhaps you could write about those experiences and what you learned from them.  That sounds doable. "
