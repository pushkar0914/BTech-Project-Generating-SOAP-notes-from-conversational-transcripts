History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time, we talked about your recovery from PTSD and how you were coping with some nightmares. Have you noticed any changes in that area? Yeah, actually. I’ve been trying to stick to my meditation routine before bed, and it seems to be helping a little bit. I’ve been focusing on breathing exercises and visualizing a peaceful place. It helps me feel more relaxed. That sounds like a wonderful practice. Have you had any particularly challenging nights recently? A few, but I think the meditation helped me get back to sleep faster. That’s a positive step! It sounds like you’re making progress. How about your feelings of anxiety or any other symptoms related to PTSD? Have they shifted at all? I still have moments of anxiety, especially when I think about my family, but it’s not as overwhelming as before. That’s encouraging to hear. It seems like you’re managing it better. Would you say that your estrangement from your family has contributed to that?"
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Yes, definitely. Not having to deal with their toxic behavior has made a big difference. I feel good about it. It was a tough decision, but I know it was the right one for me. Spending time with my dogs has been a big part of it. They always make me smile. We go on hikes, play at the park, and just cuddle on the couch. They really help me unwind. I’ve also been enjoying my reading. That cookbook I mentioned last time has been really inspiring. Yes! I made a ratatouille last week, and it turned out really well. I’d like to cook more often and maybe even host a dinner for friends. I’ve been a bit hesitant, but I think hosting could be a good way to reconnect. A bit nervous, but also excited. It’s been a while since I’ve had people over."

Current Functional Status,"I did! I finally took it to the car wash last weekend, so that felt good. I’ve been trying to keep up with my grocery shopping and meal prepping. It helps me feel more organized. I feel accomplished and proud. It’s nice to have everything planned out for the week."

Next Steps,"I could send a message to a couple of friends and see if they’d be interested in coming over. Yes, I think I’ll aim to reach out by the end of the week. That’s a great goal! How about we check in on that next time? "
