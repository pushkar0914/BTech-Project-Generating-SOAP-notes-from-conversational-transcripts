History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time, we talked about some of your feelings of not accomplishing as much as you wanted. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke? Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I still feel like I’m not where I want to be, but I’ve tried to focus on small goals instead. Learning can be very empowering. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or outlook since starting the class? A little bit, yeah. I feel more motivated. But then there are days when I feel overwhelmed again. That sounds like a solid plan. It might help with your sleep issues too. Have you noticed any patterns in your sleep since we last talked?"
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I guess I’m still worried about my family dynamics. My mom and I had another disagreement recently. We argued about how to handle my grandmother’s care again. I just feel like I want to have a say, but I also want to respect my mom’s wishes. I tried to express my feelings without being too confrontational, but it didn’t go as well as I hoped."
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,"It’s been good! I actually enjoy it, which is surprising. I thought it would just feel like more work. I think it’s because I’m learning something new and it feels like I’m actually doing something for myself. It feels nice. I can feel my shoulders relaxing. I feel more confident about it. I think it’s a good way to express myself."
Physiological Observations,"I usually try to go to bed around the same time, but I often end up scrolling through my phone for too long."
Current Functional Status,"Well, I started taking a class online about something I’m interested in, and I’m trying to get back into biking more regularly. I try to distract myself, maybe watch a movie or listen to music. Sometimes I just need to take a break."
Diagnostic Impressions,Nothing reported
Progress Evaluation,I’m glad to hear that. Let’s work on this further in our next session. Thank you for sharing today. You’ve made some great progress.
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"Breathing exercises help a bit. I learned some from a video. Just focusing on my breath for a few minutes. One technique we could explore is mindfulness. It involves being present in the moment without judgment. Would you be interested in trying a brief mindfulness exercise? Let’s role-play a scenario where you express your thoughts to your mom. I’ll be your mom, and you can practice how you’d like to approach the conversation."
Next Steps,Maybe I could set aside a few minutes in the morning or before bed to practice. Let’s set a goal together. How about aiming to put your phone away at least 30 minutes before bedtime?
