History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, just trying to get back into my routine after my trip. I remember you mentioned struggling with getting back into your exercise routine. How has that been going? It's still a challenge. I went for a couple of walks, but I find it hard to motivate myself to go regularly. I’ve been meditating daily, and that really helps too. I feel more centered when I do it. That sounds effective. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or anxiety levels since you started meditating? Well, it’s the busy season for our organization, and I feel a lot of pressure to make sure everything runs smoothly. I did have it again last week. It was frustrating because it felt so real. Not really, but I’ve been feeling more anxious about work, so maybe that’s contributing."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I’ve mentioned it to my supervisor, and she’s been supportive, which helps."
Risk Assessment,I find it hard sometimes. I don't want to seem like I'm struggling.
Mental Health Observations,"I felt relaxed and clear-headed, like it was a nice break from my work. I think it has helped reduce my anxiety, especially when I feel overwhelmed with work."
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,"I did manage to go for a short walk yesterday. It felt good, but I still have to remind myself to keep it up. I’ve been trying to prioritize my tasks and break them down into smaller steps. It helps me feel less overwhelmed. It’s been okay. Some days I stick to it, and other days I feel like I’m drowning in everything."

Progress Evaluation,Nothing reported
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"I usually take a short break, step outside, or do a quick meditation to reset. We could try some visualization techniques or journaling to express those feelings before bed. Would you be open to that?"
Next Steps,"Yeah, I’ve been thinking about just starting with short walks, maybe 15-20 minutes a day, instead of trying to do longer hikes right away. Yeah, that could be useful. Maybe I could approach it as a team effort. I like that idea. I’ll try to keep that in mind next time I feel overwhelmed. Yeah, I think I need to. I don’t want that dream to keep bothering me. Yes, I’d like that.  Definitely, I think that could help. Wonderful! Let’s set that as a goal for our next session. How about you try journaling your thoughts before sleep this week? Sounds good! I’ll give it a shot. You’re welcome! I’m glad to help. Let’s meet again next week to check in on your progress."
