History of Present Illness (HPI),"Just the same stuff, you know, work and money.  Well, I still feel stuck. I want to find something better, but I don’t know where to start.  I want to be a personal trainer, but I also want to get into real estate.  I think it’s just my mind racing about work and money.  It just feels like I’m always struggling to keep up.  I’ve tried, but it’s hard to stick to it.  I guess I don’t always have control over my spending. "

Therapeutic Interventions,Would you be open to trying some mindfulness exercises?  Mindfulness can help you calm your mind. How about starting with just five minutes of deep breathing each night? 
Next Steps,"Perhaps researching personal training certifications or real estate courses?  Awesome! Let’s make that another goal for this week.  That’s a valid concern. Would you be open to setting small spending limits for certain categories?  Great! Let’s aim for one category this week. How about dining out?  Would you consider reaching out to one friend this week to share how you’ve been feeling?  Research personal training, try mindfulness breathing, and set a dining out budget. "
