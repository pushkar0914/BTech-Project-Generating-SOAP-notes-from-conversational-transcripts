History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s a bit overwhelming, honestly. There’s so much to think about, but we’re making progress. I’m excited but also a little anxious. I want everything to go perfectly, but I know that’s unrealistic. I guess I worry about how everyone will get along and if there will be any drama. My family can be a bit… complicated. I’ve tried to remind myself that it’s about me and my partner, not everyone else. But I still can’t help but worry. Well, I’ve been thinking more about my feelings of guilt regarding my potential. It’s been on my mind a lot."

Therapeutic Interventions,How about creating a small self-care routine for the day? Maybe a few moments of deep breathing or stepping away to gather your thoughts? Exactly! You could even practice that technique here. Want to try a quick breathing exercise now?
Next Steps,"Yeah, that might be good. I think I’ll need a plan to stay calm. I like that idea. I could find a quiet spot to take a breather if I start feeling overwhelmed. I think setting small, achievable goals would help. Like focusing on my coursework and networking with others in the program. Sure! I want to read a couple of articles each week, reach out to a few professors, and maybe even attend some seminars."
