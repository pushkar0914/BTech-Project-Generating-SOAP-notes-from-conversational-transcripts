History of Present Illness (HPI),"Um, I’ve been okay. A bit better, I think. Well, I’ve been trying to focus more on the positive things in my life. Yeah, I’ve been spending more time with my cats and watching funny shows. They make me laugh. I went to the beach last weekend. It was nice, but I didn’t have enough money to do much. It’s still tough. I’m looking for jobs, but it’s hard to find something that pays enough. I’ve always wanted to try a painting class or something creative. It still comes and goes. Some days are better, but sometimes I just feel really down. I think it’s mostly when I think about my financial situation. It really gets to me. Not really. I usually just let it get to me. No, I think we covered a lot. I feel a bit better talking about everything."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Would you be open to trying some coping strategies? For example, when you start to feel overwhelmed, you could take a few deep breaths or write down your feelings."
Next Steps,"Maybe I could go for walks by the beach more often, even if I don’t spend money. That sounds like a great plan! Walking can be a wonderful way to clear your mind. How do you feel about setting a goal to walk by the beach at least once a week? I think I could do that. It would be nice. Would you be open to exploring local job resources or networking opportunities? Sometimes connecting with others can lead to new possibilities. Maybe I could start by joining a group or class. That way, I could meet people. That sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself! Plus, it might help you meet new people. How would you feel about researching some local classes? I think I could do that. It might be fun. Writing can be a powerful outlet. How about setting a goal to write about your feelings at least once or twice a week? Yeah, I think that would help."
