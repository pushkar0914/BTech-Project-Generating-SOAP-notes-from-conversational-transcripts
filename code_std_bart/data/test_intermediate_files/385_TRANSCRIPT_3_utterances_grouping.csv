History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like playing basketball really boosts your mood. Have you noticed any changes in your overall feelings since then? Yeah, I think I’ve been a bit happier. I did! I told someone they were being rude. It felt good to say something, but they didn’t listen. I felt relieved, I guess."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s a perfect plan! Keeping that routine can really help maintain your positive feelings. Now, how about those smaller situations where you wanted to practice expressing yourself? Have you had any opportunities to try that? One technique is deep breathing. When you feel frustration rising, taking a moment to breathe deeply can help ground you. Would you like to try a quick exercise together? Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... 1, 2, 3, 4... and now exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four... 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel?"
Next Steps,"I want to try. I think I can play again this week. Maybe I could try to be more calm next time. I think I want to work on being more social. That’s a great goal! We can explore ways to gradually increase your social interactions. What’s one small step you could take towards that this week? Maybe invite a friend to hang out again. That sounds perfect! Inviting a friend is a wonderful way to strengthen your connections. Let’s set that as your goal for the week.  Okay, I can do that."
