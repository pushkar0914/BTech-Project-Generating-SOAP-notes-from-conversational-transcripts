History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been okay. I made an effort to spend time with my granddaughter, and it was nice. I felt really happy. It was a nice distraction from everything else. I felt lighter afterward. It was nice to escape into a different world for a bit. I tried it a few more times, and it’s getting easier to focus.  I finally talked to her about my feelings. She was really understanding. It felt relieving. I think it helped strengthen our connection. I think it’s a mix of worrying about my daughter and feeling stuck in my own life. Sometimes talking to friends helps, but I haven’t done that much lately."

Next Steps,"Yes, I can do that. Reaching out to friends can be really beneficial. Would you like to set a goal to connect with a friend this week? Yes, I think that would help. Great! It could be a simple phone call or even a coffee date. Just something to connect with someone who supports you. I’ll try to do that."
