History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, I guess. Trying to keep up with the changes I mentioned. Yeah, I’ve been eating better, and I’ve started exercising a little. It feels good, but some days are harder than others. I think when I’m tired or stressed, I tend to fall back into old habits. Like, I’ll skip exercising or grab something unhealthy to eat. It felt good. I needed that. A little. I think she appreciates that I’m trying to be healthier, but sometimes I feel like I don’t want to burden her with my stress. Not really. I guess I’m just worried about adding to her stress."
