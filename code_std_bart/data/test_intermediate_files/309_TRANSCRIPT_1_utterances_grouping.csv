History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. Last time, you mentioned that your wife left and that it’s been hard for you. How have you been coping with that since we last spoke? Well, I’ve been trying to keep busy. I’ve been working on some new music and hanging out with friends. But sometimes it just hits me, you know? Yes, that makes sense. It's normal to have those moments. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or how you handle your anger since we last talked? A little. I’ve had a few moments where I felt like breaking something, but I’ve managed to talk myself down. It’s just frustrating. Yeah, I did some yoga last week, and it felt good. I need to do it more often, honestly. It’s kind of therapeutic, really. When I’m in the zone, I forget about everything else. It’s like my escape. I think it lets me express stuff I can’t say out loud. Sometimes I write lyrics about how I’m feeling, and it just releases a lot of pressure. Absolutely, I appreciate your willingness to share. Last time, you mentioned that you felt your anger contributed to your wife leaving. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke? Yeah, I keep thinking about how I could’ve handled things differently. I get mad so easily, and I know it pushes people away. Recognizing that is an important step. What do you think triggers your anger the most? Usually, it’s when I feel like I’m not being heard or when things don’t go my way. It’s like a switch flips. Well, there was this time when I was trying to explain something to my friend, and he interrupted me. I just lost it and yelled. I felt bad. I apologized, but it was embarrassing. I don’t want to be that guy. It felt good. I could feel the anger bubbling up, but taking that moment helped me calm down."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to breathe deeply and count to ten. It sounds cheesy, but it helps a bit. I see. Would you like to work on identifying those triggers more specifically? It could help you develop strategies to manage your reactions. It’s understandable to feel that way. Apologizing shows that you care about your relationships. What do you think could help you respond differently in those moments? Maybe I could take a breath before reacting? Like, just pause for a second? That’s a great idea! Pausing can give you space to choose how to respond rather than reacting impulsively. Would you like to practice that technique together?"
Next Steps,"That’s a powerful way to express yourself. Would you be open to sharing some of those lyrics in our next session? It could be a great way to explore your feelings further. Yeah, that sounds good. I think it would help if I knew what sets me off. Excellent! Practicing that pause can lead to more constructive conversations. Would you like to set a goal for yourself regarding this technique before our next session? Yeah, I want to try to pause for at least three seconds when I feel angry this week. I’ll let you know how it goes."
