History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! I’ve been alright. I tried breaking down my tasks like we discussed. It actually helped a lot. I felt less overwhelmed and more focused. I felt more in control, and I wasn’t as anxious about deadlines. Yes, there was a moment at work when a colleague was frustrated, and instead of getting defensive, I took a breath and listened. It ended positively. We resolved the issue without escalating it, which felt good. I’ve been thinking about how to handle negative thoughts. Sometimes I get stuck in a loop. I think I sometimes jump to conclusions or assume the worst."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I did! I tried a few breathing exercises, and they helped me calm down during stressful moments. That’s a common challenge. Would you like to explore cognitive behavioral techniques to address those thoughts? Great! One technique is identifying cognitive distortions—like all-or-nothing thinking or catastrophizing. Have you noticed any patterns in your negative thoughts? Recognizing that is a great first step. When you catch yourself doing that, try to challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself what evidence supports or contradicts them. Exactly! It’s about creating a dialogue with yourself. The next time you notice a negative thought, write it down and then write a counter-thought. Wonderful! We can review your thoughts next time and see how that process feels for you.  I agree! You’re making great strides. Remember to be patient with yourself as you implement these changes."
Next Steps,I think I’ll keep doing them. They really make a difference.
