History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay, I guess. Trying to keep my cool, but it’s still tough sometimes. Yeah, actually. I had a disagreement with a coworker last week. It was over something small, but I felt my temper flare up. I just walked away. I didn’t want to say something I’d regret. A bit relieved, honestly. I didn’t want to escalate things. I’ve had some mood swings, still. I feel like they come out of nowhere sometimes. Sometimes it’s just little things, like someone cutting me off in traffic or a comment that rubs me the wrong way. Well, I still feel like I’m not moving forward as quickly as I’d like in my career. "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to breathe deeply when I feel like I’m getting angry. It helps a little. Great! One technique we can try is cognitive reframing. It involves changing the way you think about a situation. For example, if someone cuts you off, instead of feeling angry, you could think, “Maybe they’re having a rough day.” What do you think about that approach? I guess I could look into some training or courses that would help."
Next Steps,"I want to move up at LAX, maybe into a management position. I guess I could look into some training or courses that would help. Yeah, I could research some courses by next week."
