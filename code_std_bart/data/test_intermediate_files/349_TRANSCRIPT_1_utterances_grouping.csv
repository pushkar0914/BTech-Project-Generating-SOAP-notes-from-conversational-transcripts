History of Present Illness (HPI),"Uh, I’ve been okay, I guess. Some ups and downs, you know. Well, I had a couple of good days where I felt a bit more motivated, but then I’d hit a low and feel like I’m back to square one. It’s usually just little things. Like, I’ll have a bad day at work, or I’ll see something that reminds me of my past, and it just pulls me down. Yeah, definitely. It often happens when I’m alone, or when I’m not busy. I guess I need to keep myself occupied. I’ve been trying to get back into yoga. I used to love it, but sometimes I just don’t have the energy. I think it’s mostly motivation. It feels like such a chore sometimes, and I just don’t want to do anything. Maybe. I feel like I’m trying to solve my own mystery sometimes, like why I feel this way. I think it’s figuring out why I can’t seem to shake this feeling of being lost. I used to have direction, and now it’s just... gone. I guess it’s a combination of things. Losing my support system, my job situation, and just feeling like I’m not enough anymore. Just that I appreciate you listening. It feels good to talk about these things."

Next Steps,"Maybe. Like, just doing a few minutes instead of a full session? Yeah, I think I could manage a few minutes. It might help me get back into it. Great! Let’s try that for the week. How about we check in on your progress during our next session? Yeah, I think I’d like that. Just need to look into it more."
