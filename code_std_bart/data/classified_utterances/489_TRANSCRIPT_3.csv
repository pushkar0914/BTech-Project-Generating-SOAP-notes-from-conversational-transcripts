Hi there! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
Hi Ellie! I’ve been doing well. I’ve been practicing the techniques we discussed.,P,Progress Evaluation
That’s fantastic! How has it been going for you?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been more mindful of my thoughts, and I started writing them down like you suggested.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a wonderful strategy! What have you noticed about the thoughts you’ve been writing down?,T,Insignificant
I realized that a lot of them are based on assumptions rather than facts.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a significant realization! How does that change the way you view those thoughts?,T,Insignificant
It makes me feel like I have more control. I can challenge them instead of just accepting them.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Exactly! You’re empowering yourself to shift your perspective. Have there been any specific thoughts you’ve challenged recently?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, there was a situation where I thought my boss was upset with me, but I later found out it was about something else entirely.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a perfect example of how assumptions can lead to unnecessary stress. How did it feel to realize that?,T,Insignificant
It felt relieving! I was worried for no reason.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s the power of questioning those thoughts. Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels since you’ve started this practice?,T,Insignificant
"Definitely. I’m feeling less anxious overall, and I’m more present in my daily life.",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s wonderful progress! It sounds like you’re developing a more positive mindset. Is there anything else you’d like to explore today?,T,Insignificant
I’d like to talk about setting boundaries. I sometimes feel overwhelmed with others’ expectations.,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
Boundaries are essential for maintaining your well-being. What specific areas do you feel you need to establish boundaries in?,T,Insignificant
Mostly with work. I tend to take on more than I can handle because I don’t want to let anyone down.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common struggle. It’s important to remember that saying no doesn’t mean you’re letting someone down. How do you feel about practicing saying no in small situations?,T,Insignificant
I think that would be helpful. I need to work on my assertiveness.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Absolutely! We can role-play some scenarios if you’d like, or you can start by saying no to smaller requests.",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I’d like to try role-playing. That could help me feel more prepared.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Great! Let’s practice a few scenarios. Imagine a colleague asks you to take on an extra project. How might you respond?,T,Insignificant
"I could say something like, “I appreciate the offer, but I’m currently at capacity with my workload.”",P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a strong response! How does that feel to say?,T,Insignificant
It feels good. I like that it’s respectful but firm.,P,Insignificant
Exactly! It’s about valuing your time and energy. You deserve to prioritize your needs. ,T,Insignificant
Thank you for helping me with this. I feel more equipped to handle these situations.,P,Progress Evaluation
You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Is there anything else you’d like to address today?,T,Insignificant
