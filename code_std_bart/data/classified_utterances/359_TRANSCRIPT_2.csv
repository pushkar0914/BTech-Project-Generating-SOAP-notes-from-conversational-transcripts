"Hey, Ellie! I’ve actually been doing a bit better. I tried the free writing exercise you suggested.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! How did it go?,T,Insignificant
"It felt really good to just let my thoughts flow. I didn’t worry about making it perfect, and I wrote for about fifteen minutes.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s amazing! What did you write about?,T,Insignificant
I wrote about my experiences with gambling and how it felt to lose everything. It was kind of cathartic.,P,Trauma History
That’s a powerful topic. How did it feel to put those feelings on paper?,T,Insignificant
It felt like I was releasing some pent-up emotions. I didn’t realize how much I needed to express that.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

That’s wonderful news! Consistency is key. How are you feeling overall with your sleep and mood?,T,Insignificant
"I still have my off days, but I’m feeling a bit more hopeful, which is nice.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a positive shift! It sounds like you’re making progress. Have you noticed any changes in your anger towards others?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’ve been trying to remind myself that everyone has their own battles. It’s still hard sometimes, but I’m working on it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

How do you feel about your family relationships? You mentioned feeling distant from your mother.,T,Insignificant
Still the same. I haven’t reached out. I just don’t know what to say.,P,Psychosocial History
That’s understandable. It can be tough to bridge those gaps. Would you be open to exploring ways to reconnect with her?,T,Insignificant
