<synch>,P,Insignificant
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this,T,Insignificant
yes thanks,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
so how are you doing today,T,Insignificant
i'm well thank you how are you,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
i'm great thanks,T,Insignificant
where are you from originally,T,Insignificant
i grew up in oklahoma,P,Psychosocial History
really,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
when did you move to l_a,T,Insignificant
um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here,P,Psychosocial History
how often do you go back to your hometown,T,Insignificant
my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much,P,Psychosocial History
how does it compare to l_a,T,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
oklahoma's very different um,P,Insignificant
uh l_a's a lot more exciting,P,Insignificant
there's a lot more um,P,Insignificant
uh to do here and um,P,Insignificant
uh the ocean obviously is very nice so,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
why did you move to l_a,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know that's a good question i um,P,Insignificant
i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
are you happy you did that,T,Insignificant
very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a,T,Insignificant
pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural,P,Current Functional Status
it seemed like a good fit,P,Current Functional Status
um i just really like it here,P,Current Functional Status
how do you like your living situation,T,Insignificant
oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach,P,Current Functional Status
um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or,P,Current Functional Status
um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice,P,Current Functional Status
awesome,T,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i studied philosophy and um political theory and government,P,Psychosocial History
and did a little bit of english literature on the side,P,Psychosocial History
how did you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um it,P,Insignificant
kind of just happened naturally i think uh,P,Insignificant
i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different,P,Psychosocial History
areas and,P,Insignificant
i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that,P,Psychosocial History
are you still working in that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities,P,Current Functional Status
mhm,T,Insignificant
um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often,P,Current Functional Status
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
<laughter> um,P,Insignificant
you know i have actually studied to become a success coach,P,Psychosocial History
um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice,P,Current Functional Status
aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students,P,Psychosocial History
um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams,P,Psychosocial History
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know it can be challenging for people to actually,P,Insignificant
be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um,P,Insignificant
undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it,P,Insignificant
uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so,P,Psychosocial History
why,T,Insignificant
um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people,P,Psychosocial History
i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged,P,Psychosocial History
and i think that um is,P,Insignificant
something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted,P,Psychosocial History
um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
<laughter> pretty good i think,P,Psychosocial History
um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time,P,Psychosocial History
has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no,P,Psychosocial History
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
i'm not sure,P,Insignificant
it would've probably been a discussion over politics,P,Psychosocial History
and it probably would've been a friendly argument,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
probably with one of my liberal friends so,P,Psychosocial History
but i actually can't remember the specific time,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i meditate,P,Current Functional Status
um i,P,Insignificant
do that almost every day,P,Current Functional Status
um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful,P,Current Functional Status
um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts,P,Current Functional Status
mhm,T,Insignificant
so that's nice,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
well let me think about that for a minute,P,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
<laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um,P,Insignificant
just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>,P,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
let's come back to that later,T,Insignificant
okay i'm sorry <laughter>,P,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly,P,Insignificant
um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but,P,Insignificant
um i do have it sometimes,P,Trauma History
probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it,P,Trauma History
you know if i didn't have it,P,Trauma History
um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um,P,Trauma History
it's usually me in school somewhere,P,Trauma History
at the end of the semester,P,Trauma History
haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail,P,Trauma History
and,P,Insignificant
you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i,P,Insignificant
study and attend class the way i should have,P,Insignificant
um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating,P,Trauma History
and i'm not exactly sure,P,Insignificant
why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
no i don't think so,P,Insignificant
um at least not not that i'm aware of,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew,P,Psychosocial History
and they live on the east coast,P,Insignificant
and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um,P,Psychosocial History
i when i used to live there when he was younger,P,Insignificant
um spent a lot of time with them and,P,Insignificant
since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so,P,Psychosocial History
for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back,P,Insignificant
in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them,P,Insignificant
um and that i felt bad about because,P,Insignificant
we really enjoy each other's company and he,P,Insignificant
um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back,P,Psychosocial History
so that's um,P,Insignificant
that makes me feel bad sometimes,P,Psychosocial History
i understand,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i have a brother i'm very close to him,P,Psychosocial History
he's younger,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
um he's like four four and a half years younger,P,Insignificant
he's married um i have a nephew,P,Psychosocial History
um my both of my parents have passed away,P,Psychosocial History
so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
on my father's side there's one brother,P,Psychosocial History
um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are,P,Psychosocial History
<sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um,P,Insignificant
most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um,P,Psychosocial History
so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then,P,Psychosocial History
but you know we're not that close with our extended family so,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'd say well,P,Insignificant
um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences,P,Psychosocial History
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
when i came out to california,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um,P,Insignificant
it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so,P,Insignificant
um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and,P,Insignificant
um we just established this really strong friendship and,P,Psychosocial History
she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um,P,Psychosocial History
but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um,P,Psychosocial History
and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know,P,Psychosocial History
i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice,P,Psychosocial History
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um,P,Physiological Observations
sometimes my you know,P,Insignificant
depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but,P,Physiological Observations
um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful,P,Physiological Observations
um and i can sleep,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles,P,Physiological Observations
so,P,Insignificant
um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination,P,Physiological Observations
um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night,P,Physiological Observations
or at least if i do i don't remember it,P,Physiological Observations
so,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit,P,Physiological Observations
because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home,P,Insignificant
most of the time but then i travel,P,Insignificant
like one week a month,P,Insignificant
and when i travel i'll take the red-eye,P,Insignificant
um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i,P,Physiological Observations
um sleep,P,Insignificant
poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep,P,Physiological Observations
and the first day,P,Insignificant
after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay,P,Insignificant
but usually the second day is not very good,P,Physiological Observations
um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate,P,Physiological Observations
and um,P,Insignificant
i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle,P,Physiological Observations
okay,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
i would say good,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little,P,Insignificant
um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good,P,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
not really i can't i can't think of anything um,P,Insignificant
there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i hike with friends and,P,Insignificant
um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um because i didn't really exercise when i was there,P,Insignificant
and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
it's okay,P,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
hmm well,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
he's a lot of fun and,P,Insignificant
um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and,P,Insignificant
we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and,P,Insignificant
um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun,P,Insignificant
but that i can be serious,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
that i you know care about others,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
and that i'm loyal,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
i'm not sure what else,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i think those those are probably the main things,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem,P,Psychosocial History
uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar,P,Psychosocial History
i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging,P,Psychosocial History
um and i wish that i um,P,Insignificant
xxx,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i think i wish that i was in a relationship,P,Psychosocial History
so,P,Insignificant
probably those things,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
so at the last organization i used to work at,P,Insignificant
i had a boss and she was,P,Insignificant
i don't feel like she was um,P,Insignificant
i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh,P,Insignificant
used to push my buttons or so i thought,P,Insignificant
and so um,P,Insignificant
one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer,P,Insignificant
um and he was upset about something and,P,Insignificant
it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i,P,Insignificant
have very strong opinions about how you handle,P,Insignificant
challenges with people <peo> with staff members,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought,P,Psychosocial History
um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel,P,Psychosocial History
um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
i did you know,P,Insignificant
i tried to be very calm and,P,Insignificant
said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but,P,Insignificant
uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there,P,Insignificant
to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me,P,Psychosocial History
or after we had that interaction so,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i see,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this,P,Insignificant
thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had,P,Insignificant
read it back then,P,Insignificant
which is,P,Insignificant
um when you think about buying something instead of thinking,P,Insignificant
uh oh,P,Insignificant
here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it,P,Insignificant
it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that,P,Insignificant
because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so,P,Insignificant
you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh,P,Insignificant
been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago,P,Insignificant
hmm,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
<sigh> probably,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them,P,Psychosocial History
and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them,P,Psychosocial History
so,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed,T,Insignificant
<sigh> let's see,P,Insignificant
well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore,P,Psychosocial History
uh and i got to fly first class,P,Insignificant
um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um,P,Insignificant
tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because,P,Insignificant
um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too,P,Insignificant
nice,T,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
sure,P,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
bye,P,Insignificant
