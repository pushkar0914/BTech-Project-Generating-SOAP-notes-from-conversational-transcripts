that was fun,P,Psychosocial History
i'm glad i got to do that,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm kind of shy by nature,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i've tried to grow out of being shy so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm not fully shy but i was always a an extremely shy,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
child,P,Insignificant
but now here in culver city this is my,P,Insignificant
environment and i i guess you could say i'm not really shy in,P,Insignificant
in my hometown of culver city,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
hm,P,Current Functional Status
to relax i like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap,P,Current Functional Status
watch t_v,P,Current Functional Status
sometimes on the couch in the living room,P,Current Functional Status
just you know stay at home and,P,Current Functional Status
kinda vegetate,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Mental Health Observations
uh pretty good yeah my temper's pretty level,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
hm,P,Insignificant
probably with my,P,Psychosocial History
husband,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
i can't remember at the moment what it was about,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
um well when you say my family do you mean,P,Psychosocial History
my  family from childhood or my current family,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Psychosocial History
okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i i have two daughters,P,Insignificant
and,P,Psychosocial History
my relationship's pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which uh,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Psychosocial History
going they're going through a lot of hormones and,P,Insignificant
um,P,Psychosocial History
they can be kinda bitchy <laughter> and,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Psychosocial History
and um but i have hoped that you know they'll grow out of that and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship,P,Insignificant
um and then there's the husband which,P,Psychosocial History
i i guess i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon  <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
we need to get a divorce but we're still together,P,Psychosocial History
due to financial reasons,P,Insignificant
and yeah,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
yeah so that that's not good the,P,Psychosocial History
the relationship with the husband but um,P,Psychosocial History
but since we have determined that we need to divorce,P,Psychosocial History
our our we don't expect anything out out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
hm,P,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
i guess,P,Psychosocial History
our marriage,P,Insignificant
i wish i had noticed early on that,P,Insignificant
you know it was like way off from what i thought it was,P,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
um <sigh> let's see oh my god,P,Insignificant
hardest decision,P,Psychosocial History
i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
um well you know we were married and i wasn't,P,Psychosocial History
content i guess you could say,P,Insignificant
um and,P,Insignificant
i kinda just,P,Insignificant
gave up on our relationship and,P,Insignificant
i i now that i look back i think it's because,P,Insignificant
i wanted,P,Psychosocial History
children and he would've been happy to never have any,P,Psychosocial History
and so uh since i didn't have a father,P,Insignificant
it was very important,P,Insignificant
that i,P,Psychosocial History
create children with someone who really wanted to be a father,P,Insignificant
and so i was kind of,P,Insignificant
at a age where i needed to start thinking about,P,Psychosocial History
having children,P,Insignificant
yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that,P,Insignificant
i think that's one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just,P,Insignificant
felt like,P,Insignificant
<tisk> this marriage isn't gonna work and,P,Insignificant
so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and,P,Insignificant
<tisk> um,P,Insignificant
<tisk> and i had to leave him,P,Psychosocial History
because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very  hard 'cause,P,Psychosocial History
you know,P,Insignificant
i felt like i was hurting him  which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now he's  married with two kids <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
<laughter> but um,P,Insignificant
it was,P,Insignificant
hard,P,Insignificant
to leave him,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
something i wish i could erase from my memory,P,Insignificant
i have to think about that,P,Insignificant
i'm sure there's something <gasp> oh well,P,Insignificant
yeah there's um,P,Insignificant
i guess it'd be nice to erase,P,Insignificant
from my memory  um a recent i mean not recent but an event,P,Insignificant
in my,P,Insignificant
recent adulthood here in culver city,P,Psychosocial History
where one of my best friends,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
i've betrayed me by,P,Psychosocial History
back years ago when my husband first got into real estate,P,Psychosocial History
she and her family were growing and they really needed  a larger home,P,Psychosocial History
and,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
we just assumed that you know that they would use,P,Psychosocial History
my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time,P,Psychosocial History
and purchase a new home,P,Psychosocial History
<tisk> and as it turned out,P,Psychosocial History
they surprised us and,P,Psychosocial History
had been talking to this other local agent,P,Psychosocial History
and uh yeah,P,Insignificant
that was devastating,P,Psychosocial History
i don't think i had ever  been betrayed,P,Psychosocial History
like that,P,Psychosocial History
so i wish i could  erase that now 'cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say,P,Psychosocial History
six maybe,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
maybe five,P,Insignificant
anyway her <h>,P,Insignificant
her and my best friend's,P,Psychosocial History
daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other,P,Psychosocial History
we were pregnant together,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school  so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd,P,Psychosocial History
run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were,P,Psychosocial History
just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her,P,Psychosocial History
their moms weren't talking to each other anymore,P,Psychosocial History
so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together,P,Psychosocial History
and they're still very connected in fact <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter,P,Psychosocial History
and another girl,P,Psychosocial History
and it's just a little awkward you know 'cause now,P,Psychosocial History
these girls are,P,Psychosocial History
becoming really good friends better friends,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
and yet,P,Insignificant
i still have this,P,Insignificant
vivid,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
bad memory,P,Psychosocial History
of what her,P,Insignificant
her mom did to,P,Psychosocial History
to me,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
that was about what,P,Insignificant
ten,P,Insignificant
about eight years ago,P,Psychosocial History
anyway,P,Insignificant
<sigh> i tried to i tried to,P,Insignificant
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
ignore it and put it out of my head and,P,Psychosocial History
which i've been able to <sniff>,P,Psychosocial History
in recent years,P,Psychosocial History
but obviously it still comes up,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
anyway that that was that,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
<sniff>,P,Physiological Observations
um not that easy,P,Physiological Observations
i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but,P,Physiological Observations
sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up,P,Physiological Observations
and can't get back to sleep,P,Physiological Observations
uh or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that,P,Insignificant
that difficult thing,P,Insignificant
are they triggered by something,T,Physiological Observations
well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom <laughter>,P,Insignificant
and then um,P,Physiological Observations
<tisk> you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom,P,Physiological Observations
so i guess that's the trigger,P,Physiological Observations
as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there,P,Physiological Observations
i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind,P,Physiological Observations
running through my mind and the day,P,Physiological Observations
i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so,P,Physiological Observations
it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to,P,Insignificant
i guess,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
um,P,Physiological Observations
well i'm kinda used to it now,P,Insignificant
so i just go on,P,Physiological Observations
through the day probably looking <laughter> looking tired and um,P,Physiological Observations
i i'm kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do,P,Insignificant
and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have,P,Physiological Observations
huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something,P,Physiological Observations
read my book watch t_v watch whatever,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
lately how have i been feeling um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
kind of down,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
on myself down on life,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
well i have this pending,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
need <n> need for separation slash divorce,P,Insignificant
um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
<tisk> i worry that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know on the verge of adulthood,P,Insignificant
<clears throat>,P,Insignificant
and so i worry that,P,Insignificant
you know,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i did all kinds of things wrong,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
with their guidance and their early childhood and  <clears throat> now it's too late,P,Insignificant
um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
like i missed out on a thing <th> a lot of things,P,Insignificant
uh,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i wanna do with my life,P,Insignificant
i know i wanna do something i i,P,Insignificant
i just wish,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so i i regret that extremely,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself 'cause i need to,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
divorce and move on with my life,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
now i forget what the original question was but  <laughter>,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
that's the state,P,Insignificant
part of the state of my life,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
no,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
yes,P,Insignificant
how long ago were you diagnosed,T,Insignificant
mm <tisk>,P,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
the first time or or or recently,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
the first time i guess was,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
upset about <laughter> coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then,P,Insignificant
i was um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
<tisk> in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting 'cause i,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
you know it was hard because he didn't wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i didn't understand this feeling,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i was really upset,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how i didn't that was my first time having depression so i didn't really,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
recognize <r> recognize it as depression but i went somehow i,P,Insignificant
had the,P,Insignificant
knowledge or the,P,Insignificant
i was able to,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i guess it's usually a relationship <laughter> you know,P,Insignificant
um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and put on meds,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
that was probably about,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
two years ago,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
do you still go to therapy now,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
no,P,Insignificant
why did you stop,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
um money i i don't have insurance,P,Insignificant
otherwise yeah i'd be happy to,P,Insignificant
go to therapy <laughter>,P,Insignificant
anything that might help,P,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
ooh <laughter>,P,Insignificant
boy,P,Insignificant
last time i felt really happy,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know i guess maybe,P,Psychosocial History
when my children were born,P,Insignificant
that's,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i guess happy i don't know <laughter> i just you know,P,Psychosocial History
i always wanted children so it was nice,P,Psychosocial History
to have them,P,Insignificant
that's,P,Psychosocial History
i don't know that's all i can remember of that i don't i guess i don't remember the good times too well <laughter> i remember the bad times,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed,T,Insignificant
<sniff>,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
something i did that i really enjoyed,P,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
let's see i um,P,Psychosocial History
friday night i went to a friend's house,P,Psychosocial History
and met up with,P,Psychosocial History
five other girlfriends and we,P,Psychosocial History
we created vision boards,P,Psychosocial History
and talked and,P,Psychosocial History
had dinner,P,Psychosocial History
at one of their house that was that was fun,P,Insignificant
that sounds like a great situation,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
we get to,P,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
ooh <sigh>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
stay in college get my degree,P,Insignificant
um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
get therapy try to become a happy,P,Insignificant
um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah try to figure out things earlier in life,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to <laughter> no matter what you're depressed about it seems like,P,Insignificant
as as the saying goes and the songs <s> the,P,Insignificant
songs go you know,P,Insignificant
it's all about money the world revolves around money and,P,Insignificant
having none,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so besides relationships and different things  that have happened in your life,P,Insignificant
having no money,P,Insignificant
is,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it,P,Insignificant
so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and to stick <s> get a job and stick with it,P,Insignificant
um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
don't quit,P,Insignificant
to go traveling you know,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
just stick with a job stick with a company build up your,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
seniority keep your benefits,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field,P,Insignificant
yeah that would've been,P,Insignificant
my biggest piece of advice to myself,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
not much <laughter>,P,Insignificant
i guess,P,Psychosocial History
just my daughters you know they're,P,Psychosocial History
beautiful daughters and,P,Psychosocial History
i'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people,P,Psychosocial History
aren't even able to do that you know and they  try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so,P,Psychosocial History
that's the one thing i mean i wanted,P,Psychosocial History
five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but,P,Insignificant
um i'm,P,Insignificant
i guess that's the,P,Insignificant
biggest thing i can,P,Psychosocial History
think of to be proud of,P,Psychosocial History
is having my two daughters,P,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
um,P,Psychosocial History
i'm a very loyal,P,Psychosocial History
friend and person,P,Insignificant
that's why,P,Psychosocial History
when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating,P,Insignificant
yeah very loyal um,P,Insignificant
very,P,Psychosocial History
<inhale> happy <hap> i mean huh what was i gonna say i was gonna say happy lucky <l> go lucky i don't know where that came from i'm very i meant to say friendly,P,Insignificant
and,P,Psychosocial History
caring and,P,Psychosocial History
um yeah i care about people,P,Psychosocial History
and i'm interested in people,P,Insignificant
and,P,Psychosocial History
i care about,P,Psychosocial History
animals as well,P,Psychosocial History
actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian,P,Psychosocial History
yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian,P,Psychosocial History
i'm a vegetarian because i really care about,P,Psychosocial History
feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and,P,Psychosocial History
you know i don't think that animals should be  tortured,P,Psychosocial History
and live a a tortuous life,P,Psychosocial History
just so we can eat 'em,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
so um,P,Insignificant
what was the question,P,Insignificant
do you remember the question,P,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
