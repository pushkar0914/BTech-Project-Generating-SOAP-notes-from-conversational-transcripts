That’s a great improvement! It sounds like you’re on the right track. How about the family call you wanted to organize?,T,Insignificant
"I did reach out to my sister, and we set up a call for this weekend!",P,Insignificant
That’s excellent! How do you feel about that?,T,Insignificant
"I’m a bit nervous, but also excited. It’s been a while since we all talked.",P,Psychosocial History
"It’s completely natural to feel nervous. Just remember, it’s an opportunity to reconnect. What do you hope to discuss during the call?",T,Insignificant
I want to catch up and see how everyone is doing. Maybe share some stories.,P,Insignificant
That sounds lovely. Storytelling can really strengthen connections. Is there anything you want to prepare for the call?,T,Insignificant
"I think I’ll write down some questions to ask them, so I don’t get too anxious.",P,Psychosocial History
That’s a great strategy! Having a plan can help ease those nerves. What kind of questions do you have in mind?,T,Insignificant
"Just asking about their lives, what’s new, and sharing some of my art projects.",P,Insignificant
Those sound like wonderful conversation starters. It’s great that you want to share your art with them. ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think they’d love to hear about it.",P,Insignificant
"Now, let’s talk about your anxiety. Have you continued using the grounding techniques we practiced?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yes, I’ve been using them when I feel anxious, especially at work.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

Fantastic! It sounds like you’re developing a strong toolkit for managing your anxiety. Are there any other techniques you’d like to explore?,T,Insignificant
I’ve heard about mindfulness meditation. I’d like to try that.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Mindfulness meditation can be very beneficial. Would you like to practice a short mindfulness exercise together now?,T,Insignificant
"Yes, I’d love that!",P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s start by taking a few deep breaths together. Inhale deeply through your nose... and exhale slowly through your mouth. ,T,Insignificant
*breathes in and out*,P,Insignificant
"Now, as you continue to breathe, focus on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body. Notice any thoughts that come up, and gently guide your focus back to your breath.",T,Insignificant
*breathes* ,P,Insignificant
How does that feel for you?,T,Insignificant
It feels calming. I can feel my shoulders relaxing.,P,Physiological Observations

"Yes, I’ll try to do it every morning.",P,Next Steps
Perfect! I’m excited to hear how it goes. Is there anything else you’d like to explore today?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been thinking about my past and how it still affects me. ,P,Trauma History
That’s an important topic. Can you elaborate on what you’ve been reflecting on?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been thinking about my time as a professional fighter and how I sometimes feel like I’m still fighting those battles in my head.,P,Trauma History

I think they create a lot of pressure to succeed and not fail again. It’s like I’m always on guard.,P,Trauma History
That makes a lot of sense. It’s common for past experiences to influence our present. Have you thought about how you can reframe those experiences?,T,Insignificant
I haven’t really. I guess I just see them as failures.,P,Trauma History
"What if we looked at them as learning experiences instead? Each fight taught you something valuable, right?",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I learned a lot about discipline and resilience.",P,Trauma History
Exactly! Those qualities can serve you well in your current life. How might you apply those lessons to your daily challenges?,T,Insignificant
"I could remind myself that setbacks are part of growth, not failures.",P,Trauma History
That’s a powerful mindset! I encourage you to keep that perspective as you move forward. It can help lessen the weight of those past experiences.,T,Insignificant
"Thank you, Ellie. That makes sense.",P,Insignificant
You’re welcome! I’m proud of you for being willing to explore these feelings. It’s a big step in your healing journey. ,T,Insignificant

Of course! Let’s continue to build on this progress next time we meet. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we wrap up?,T,Insignificant
