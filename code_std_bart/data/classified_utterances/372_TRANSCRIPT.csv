they're,P,Insignificant
pretty good i've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups,P,Insignificant
what was it about,T,Insignificant
<laughter> it's about,P,Insignificant
a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries,P,Insignificant
to not become a jerk with them,P,Insignificant
and <laughter> it puts him in like a really,P,Insignificant
aw,T,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life,P,Insignificant
awesome,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
do you find it easy to be a parent,T,Insignificant
um no,P,Insignificant
i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Risk Assessment
um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
how do i cope,P,Insignificant
<deep breath>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
well right now,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that was the problem,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
what's the best thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
it's so spontaneous,P,Insignificant
like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and,P,Insignificant
just brings a smile to your face,P,Insignificant
can you give me an example of that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well when my son was younger,P,Insignificant
once we were just sitting around the house and,P,Insignificant
he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me,P,Insignificant
mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails,P,Insignificant
so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen,P,Insignificant
that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what's the hardest thing about being a parent,T,Insignificant
the hardest thing <sigh>,P,Insignificant
not wanting to screw it up,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i feel a lot of stress and pressure,P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Risk Assessment
that,P,Insignificant
every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
in what kind of person my kid turns out to be,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
definitely,P,Insignificant
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
i think,P,Insignificant
i'm different from my mom,P,Insignificant
because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction,P,Insignificant
i welcome it you know i welcome,P,Insignificant
getting to know who my child is right now,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just,P,Insignificant
see them become the best,P,Insignificant
child that they can be the best adult that they can be without,P,Insignificant
molding them in that direction necessarily,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
into a different person <laughter>,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
say it again,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
who's someone that's a positive influence,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i don't really have anybody,P,Insignificant
like that,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
often enough,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i've tried,P,Insignificant
to like go for walks but i don't always do that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i don't always stick with it,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
yeah that's about it,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
i'd say,P,Insignificant
i'm,P,Insignificant
a little below average meaning,P,Insignificant
that i get angry,P,Insignificant
more than most people do i think,P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Risk Assessment
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
last night,P,Insignificant
<laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband,P,Insignificant
um we have my sister lives with us,P,Insignificant
and she lives with us in a very small room with,P,Insignificant
a small apartment i should say,P,Insignificant
and she's got four people living in in one room so um,P,Insignificant
it's kind of stressful it's really crowded,P,Current Functional Status
and my husband is stressed out about it,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
you know i'm just saying to him that,P,Insignificant
i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here,P,Insignificant
then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do,P,Insignificant
that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded,P,Insignificant
and every day they're asking for rides and my husband,P,Insignificant
he's,P,Insignificant
avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore,P,Insignificant
and i'm just saying that,P,Insignificant
he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because,P,Insignificant
he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter>,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
that sucks,T,Insignificant
it does <laughter>,P,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
oh,P,Insignificant
i've got tons of 'em but right now,P,Insignificant
what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
right now like,P,Insignificant
i've been arguing with my stepmom,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
my stepsister for a long time about,P,Insignificant
my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated,P,Insignificant
like they don't have any boundaries,P,Insignificant
and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child,P,Insignificant
they let my child boss 'em around and stuff,P,Insignificant
anyways because of this,P,Insignificant
they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that,P,Insignificant
oh no,T,Insignificant
yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom,P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Risk Assessment
because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different,P,Insignificant
ideas about child raising,P,Insignificant
she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
she's,P,Insignificant
she really doesn't she's really far removed from,P,Insignificant
how i was raised and i wanna raise my child,P,Insignificant
more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild,P,Insignificant
and have everything that he wants,P,Insignificant
and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes,P,Insignificant
and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules,P,Insignificant
and not,P,Insignificant
trying to go and break all of my rules,P,Insignificant
<sigh> anyway <laughter>,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
um in that moment <sigh>,P,Insignificant
just really frustrated because they don't listen to me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i feel,P,Insignificant
disrespected i feel,P,Insignificant
like invisible,P,Insignificant
i feel,P,Insignificant
just angry,P,Insignificant
that,P,Insignificant
they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i went to school and i studied child development,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter>,P,Insignificant
i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and,P,Insignificant
to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent,P,Insignificant
try and tell me that i'm a bad parent,P,Insignificant
it's really,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
hard to believe so i feel very disrespected,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
unacknowledged angry frustrated,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
all those things <laughter>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i take i take benadryl to help me sleep,P,Physiological Observations
and i'm,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
<laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep,P,Medications
and last night i was crying,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
before i went to sleep,P,Insignificant
so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
hmm,T,Insignificant
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
yeah i'm always thinking about my son,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
how i wish he was with me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and like i don't deserve,P,Insignificant
to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know,P,Insignificant
<sobbing>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and i'm too hard on myself so,P,Insignificant
but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i just,P,Insignificant
i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me,P,Insignificant
and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because,P,Insignificant
i know he can do more for him,P,Insignificant
financially than i could,P,Insignificant
but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um,P,Insignificant

not that bad,P,Insignificant
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
um <sigh> hmm,P,Insignificant
my husband complains a lot he says,P,Insignificant
i'm not the same person,P,Insignificant
that i was when he married me,P,Insignificant
he said i was fun and i was positive and,P,Insignificant
i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle>,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago,P,Insignificant
and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such,P,Insignificant
a shock,P,Insignificant
and um,P,Insignificant
i've just been trying to get back from it,P,Insignificant
but it's been hard,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
did you think you had a problem before you found out,T,Insignificant
did i think i had a problem before i found out,P,Insignificant
found out what,P,Insignificant
what were your symptoms,T,Insignificant
oh,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
like um,P,Insignificant
my family would invite me,P,Insignificant
to family events,P,Insignificant
and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
or um,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
it's just all the crying i think,P,Insignificant
and like i said my husband,P,Insignificant
letting me know that i'm not the same person,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
he's disappointed,P,Insignificant
and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too,P,Insignificant
another thing i'm feeling bad about,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
<crying>,P,Insignificant
do you still go to therapy now,T,Insignificant

do i feel like the therapy's useful,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week,P,Progress Evaluation
so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter>,P,Progress Evaluation
um,P,Insignificant
that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards,P,Progress Evaluation
um,P,Insignificant

you know and then she said something about,P,Insignificant
why don't you go back to school and,P,Insignificant
so i went and applied to go back to school,P,Current Functional Status
you know i'm not doing,P,Insignificant
much with my life and,P,Insignificant
