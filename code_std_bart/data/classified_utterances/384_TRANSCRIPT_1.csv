"Hi, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"I've been okay, I guess. Still dealing with some of the same stuff.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Well, I did try to reach out to a couple of people online, but it didn’t go as well as I hoped. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Can you tell me more about that?,T,Insignificant
"I joined a forum about filmmaking, thinking I might connect with some like-minded people, but it felt awkward. I ended up just lurking instead of participating.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds frustrating. What do you think held you back from participating?,T,Insignificant
I guess I just felt like I wouldn’t fit in. It’s like I’m always worried that people won’t like me.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Maybe if I had a friend to go with me or someone to talk to before I jump in, I might feel better about it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"Yeah, I guess I could try. But I’m just not sure how to start.",P,Insignificant
"We could work on some strategies together. One idea is to set small, achievable goals. For example, maybe you could aim to post a comment on that forum next week. How does that sound?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That sounds doable. I could try that.,P,Next Steps
"Great! And remember, it’s okay to take your time. Building connections can be a gradual process. Let’s talk about how you can manage any anxiety you might feel when trying to engage with others.",T,Insignificant
I usually just freeze up and don’t know what to say.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"I just lay there and try to go back to sleep, but my mind starts racing.",P,Physiological Observations
