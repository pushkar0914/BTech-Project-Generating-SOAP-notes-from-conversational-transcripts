what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
traveling,P,Insignificant
like cleaner air that's good it's healthier for your body,P,Psychosocial History
cleaner bloodflow,P,Psychosocial History
the um people,P,Psychosocial History
culture,P,Psychosocial History
and stories and when you come back you share stories with like your friends,P,Psychosocial History
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
yeah um any time,P,Insignificant
like right now,P,Insignificant
or when,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples,P,Insignificant
and um it started raining,P,Insignificant
so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go,P,Insignificant
the the smaller the steps get,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
like people back then had,P,Insignificant
uh smaller feet,P,Insignificant
so what happened was,P,Insignificant
as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways,P,Insignificant
so my feet could measure up to the the the steps,P,Insignificant
but once you get up there it's a nice view,P,Insignificant
i yeah,P,Insignificant
awesome,T,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
uh general education but,P,Insignificant
um mainly art,P,Psychosocial History
yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes,P,Psychosocial History
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
um well,P,Insignificant
when i was a kid,P,Insignificant
i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so,P,Psychosocial History
i just pursued it,P,Psychosocial History
so,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
my dream job,P,Insignificant
would be to get paid for painting,P,Psychosocial History
painting art,P,Psychosocial History
(laughter,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
pretty simple,P,Insignificant
how hard is that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
persistence,P,Psychosocial History
and faith and will,P,Psychosocial History
you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed,P,Psychosocial History
mm,T,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Insignificant
i consider myself to be shy in certain um,P,Insignificant
time and places,P,Insignificant
but i am also out outgoing when,P,Insignificant
like i have the energy,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
i feel like it's well balanced you know,P,Insignificant
like i'm shy when it's,P,Insignificant
i guess,P,Insignificant
okay to be shy,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
and i'm outgoing when,P,Insignificant
like the need to actually,P,Insignificant
um have fun or just explore,P,Insignificant
it feels good like,P,Insignificant
if that makes sense but yeah,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
to uh relax,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter>,P,Substance Use History
so that helps,P,Substance Use History
and,P,Insignificant
i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax,P,Therapeutic Interventions
you know especially when i use the color blue,P,Therapeutic Interventions
because the color blue um relaxes me,P,Therapeutic Interventions
and also green,P,Therapeutic Interventions
when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down,P,Therapeutic Interventions
cool,T,Insignificant
yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
my temper,P,Insignificant
um well my thoughts,P,Insignificant
my thoughts control my emotions,P,Insignificant
and my emotions,P,Insignificant
yeah that's pretty much how,P,Insignificant
my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad,P,Insignificant
or if i do get mad what will be the outcome,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
controlling my temper is just,P,Insignificant
by training my thought,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
the last time i argued with somebody,P,Insignificant
was with my with my father,P,Psychosocial History
and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine,P,Psychosocial History
so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no,P,Psychosocial History
so that kinda frustrated me,P,Psychosocial History
and,P,Insignificant
the way i handled it was like well,P,Insignificant
i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
my family,P,Psychosocial History
um it's pretty good,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
my mom my dad have a good relationship still <s>still married,P,Psychosocial History
and my brothers and sisters,P,Psychosocial History
um we help one another out,P,Psychosocial History
so that's good it's just,P,Insignificant
yeah it's like a team,P,Psychosocial History
that's good,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
a situation i wish i could handle differently would be,P,Insignificant
hmm,P,Insignificant
that's a good question,P,Insignificant
i mean,P,Insignificant
can i get a scenerio,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
a situation i could handle differently,P,Insignificant
well see that's the thing like i feel like,P,Insignificant
if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out,P,Insignificant
you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube,P,Insignificant
maybe,P,Insignificant
how would i handle the situation would be just by,P,Insignificant
uh failing um failing making mistakes,P,Insignificant
because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
that's the best way i could answer your question,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
a positive influence,P,Insignificant
pretty much,P,Insignificant
anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence  influence  you know,P,Psychosocial History
like,P,Insignificant
yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt,P,Insignificant
well they're not trying to be mean they're actually,P,Insignificant
good influences so i would say my friends,P,Psychosocial History
uh my mom my dad,P,Psychosocial History
my brother my sisters,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
well see that's the thing like,P,Insignificant
you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife,P,Trauma History
but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware,P,Trauma History
and,P,Insignificant
it taught me how to read people a little bit more like,P,Insignificant
just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like,P,Insignificant
scar me,P,Trauma History
it did prepare me for like,P,Insignificant
the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like,P,Insignificant
you know like guns knives and all that stuff so,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
it's it's bad but it's good in the long term,P,Insignificant
you know because,P,Insignificant
if you get out of that slump,P,Insignificant
it's like,P,Insignificant
nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
so yeah,P,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
the hardest,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
man,P,Insignificant
this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
life changing,P,Insignificant
whether to continue school,P,Insignificant
college,P,Insignificant
or not,P,Insignificant
mm i kinda chose,P,Insignificant
to like,P,Insignificant
i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like,P,Insignificant
like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in,P,Psychosocial History
so that was a hard choice because there was no,P,Insignificant
um guarantee that i would,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
run into like the right people,P,Insignificant
but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
are you happy you did that,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um it's actually really easy,P,Physiological Observations
i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know,P,Physiological Observations
i could just like shut down my mind like yeah just calm down,P,Physiological Observations
wow,T,Insignificant
like like slow down my air pattern,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
mhm,P,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
lately,P,Insignificant
i've been feeling,P,Insignificant
good,P,Insignificant
i've been feeling like i have free will,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
like at this point in time i feel like,P,Insignificant
if i chose a path any path,P,Insignificant
with like,P,Insignificant
my heart,P,Insignificant
i could,P,Insignificant
get there you know,P,Insignificant
but i'm kind of like,P,Insignificant
still deciding it's like everything in all all these paths are in the air,P,Insignificant
just trying to make my own i don't know,P,Insignificant
that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will,P,Insignificant
so yeah,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
lately like in the past two weeks or today,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
uh yeah you know like,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
things happen that would change like,P,Insignificant
my feelings and,P,Insignificant
for example right now it just happened,P,Insignificant
like what,T,Insignificant
huh,P,Insignificant
for right now like,P,Insignificant
like what,T,Insignificant
this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
because,P,Insignificant
yeah it's like,P,Insignificant
it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
one could take a thought,P,Insignificant
and then make it,P,Insignificant
reality,P,Insignificant
so that's kinda like shifting my thoughts right now,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
this experience this this whole experience,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
uh post traumatic stress disorder,P,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant

but diagnosed by a doctor no,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
uh depression,P,Insignificant
how,P,Insignificant
how it feels,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
how does depression feel like,P,Insignificant
it feels like,P,Insignificant
it's like a bird in a cage,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
being depression is like,P,Insignificant
being <ss> a fish who can't swim in the water,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
pretty much it feels,P,Insignificant
like you're limited,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but then the thing is,P,Insignificant
to get out of that depression,P,Insignificant
it's like you have to,P,Insignificant
awaken and change your perspective,P,Insignificant
and focus on,P,Insignificant
like i i would say colors colors help,P,Therapeutic Interventions
and people talking to people helps,P,Therapeutic Interventions
yeah,P,Insignificant
when was the last time that happened,T,Insignificant
um being depressed,P,Insignificant
mm let's see,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
it could <cou> it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so,P,Insignificant
like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but then what happened i fixed it like,P,Insignificant
called up a friend and,P,Insignificant
met up with him and yeah,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i'm talking to a virtual person it's pretty cool,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
right now i feel happy,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
awesome,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
sometimes hard headed,P,Insignificant
like he would try to teach me um,P,Insignificant
a certain lesson whether it's art,P,Insignificant
or just like in my character,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
yeah he would probably just describe me as like,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
he would listen,P,Insignificant
but at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do,P,Insignificant
so pretty much like,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
yeah i mean that's what he tells me,P,Insignificant
but yeah overall good person,P,Psychosocial History
mm,T,Insignificant
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
um probably just exercise,P,Insignificant
um my diet food,P,Insignificant
my food intake,P,Insignificant
and yeah just exercise,P,Insignificant
pretty much it,P,Insignificant
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself,T,Insignificant
my health,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
i would say when i was like in middle school,P,Insignificant
or,P,Insignificant
in elementary,P,Insignificant
a little bit of high school too,P,Insignificant
but what it would,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
yeah what it would be was it would either be about,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well pretty much my art <laughter>,P,Insignificant
like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kinda like,P,Insignificant
like trash,P,Insignificant
and then i'd be like oh,P,Insignificant
damn,P,Insignificant
either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it,P,Insignificant
or what i would do back then would be like damn you know,P,Insignificant
just kinda dwell on that thought,P,Insignificant
and then just like,P,Insignificant
stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it,P,Insignificant
but yeah,P,Insignificant
usually it's um people's words,P,Insignificant
and ideas,P,Insignificant
that,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
yeah so that's it,P,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant

but,P,Insignificant
i mean at the same time i feel like,P,Insignificant
if i really wanted to go,P,Insignificant
i would have gone,P,Insignificant
so yeah,P,Insignificant
that's kind of a regret in my head,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
ten or twenty years ago would be um seek spiritual,P,Insignificant
well being,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
learn how to um handle your thoughts choose your thoughts i would teach myself,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
pick the right <r> people you surround yourself with because that   definitely has a major influence in your environment,P,Psychosocial History
uh certain events you would experience,P,Insignificant
and as far as your overall happiness,P,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
yeah among other things but yeah,P,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
what i'm most proud of right now,P,Insignificant
