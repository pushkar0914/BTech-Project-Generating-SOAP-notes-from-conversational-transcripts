i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness,P,Mental Health Observations
i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like,P,Mental Health Observations
i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um,P,Psychosocial History
you know uh,P,Insignificant
like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends,P,Psychosocial History
but it's the same time i i just feel like it's,P,Insignificant
it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a,P,Insignificant
a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know,P,Insignificant
