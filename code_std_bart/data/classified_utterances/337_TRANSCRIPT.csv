i'm great thanks,T,Insignificant
where are you from originally,T,Insignificant
i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley,P,Psychosocial History
really,T,Insignificant
what are some things you really like about l_a,T,Insignificant
i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just,P,Psychosocial History
not,P,Insignificant
as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
what are some things you don't really like about l_a,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean,P,Psychosocial History
there's not that much i don't like,P,Psychosocial History

what'd you study at school,T,Insignificant
i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that,P,Psychosocial History
awesome,T,Insignificant
are you still working in that,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
what do you do now,T,Insignificant
right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera,P,Current Functional Status
so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to,P,Current Functional Status
performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily,P,Current Functional Status
so it's actually a pretty good gig,P,Current Functional Status
okay,T,Insignificant
and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that,P,Current Functional Status
do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the ,P,Current Functional Status
why,T,Insignificant
because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter>,P,Current Functional Status
so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life,P,Current Functional Status
okay,T,Insignificant
do you consider yourself an introvert,T,Insignificant
sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people,P,Psychosocial History
but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family  ,P,Psychosocial History
don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know,P,Psychosocial History
i'd rather keep to myself,P,Psychosocial History
uh huh,T,Insignificant
how close are you to your family,T,Insignificant
uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so,P,Psychosocial History
i'm sorry to hear that,T,Insignificant
but like,P,Insignificant
thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and,P,Psychosocial History
you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together ,P,Psychosocial History
right,T,Insignificant
but it's,P,Insignificant
somewhat close,P,Psychosocial History
okay,T,Insignificant
what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
mostly i sing or i read or i write or,P,Current Functional Status
just,P,Insignificant
hang out and try to,P,Insignificant
clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just,P,Current Functional Status
clear everything and see what starts coming back in,P,Current Functional Status
and,P,Insignificant
sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things,P,Current Functional Status
um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever,P,Current Functional Status
uh huh,T,Insignificant
works but,P,Insignificant
mostly in my free time i create things,P,Current Functional Status
okay,T,Insignificant
do you travel a lot,T,Insignificant
i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um,P,Psychosocial History
i mean my idea of,P,Insignificant
like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip,P,Psychosocial History
and i like to travel more um,P,Psychosocial History
i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel,P,Psychosocial History
what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change ,P,Psychosocial History
i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of ,P,Psychosocial History
where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that,P,Psychosocial History
uh huh,T,Insignificant
but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>,P,Psychosocial History
<laughter>,T,Insignificant
<laughter> <clears throat>,P,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
let's see,P,Insignificant
xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line,P,Psychosocial History
um my cousin and i would take what we call,P,Psychosocial History
exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just  ,P,Psychosocial History
sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off,P,Psychosocial History
so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight,P,Psychosocial History
just small short trips that,P,Psychosocial History
aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how,P,Psychosocial History
um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas ,P,Psychosocial History
uh huh,T,Insignificant
so close to home but not,P,Insignificant
but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that,P,Psychosocial History
kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
so i i like i like doing that,P,Psychosocial History
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
cool,T,Insignificant
when was the last time that happened,T,Insignificant
the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am,P,Psychosocial History
and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live,P,Psychosocial History
so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas,P,Psychosocial History
and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda,P,Psychosocial History
i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there,P,Psychosocial History
and we came back and was,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
it was kind of an interesting,P,Insignificant
what are some things that make you really mad,T,Insignificant
uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back  ,P,Risk Assessment
and,P,Insignificant
i actually,P,Insignificant
like to see people who are,P,Insignificant
strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate,P,Risk Assessment
yeah,T,Insignificant
or what have you,P,Insignificant
so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason,P,Risk Assessment
you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it,P,Risk Assessment
just that kinda really just makes me mad,P,Risk Assessment
uh huh,T,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what do you do when you're annoyed,T,Insignificant
when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either  ,P,Risk Assessment
you know verbally just,P,Insignificant
cutting 'em with a quip or,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody,P,Insignificant
but i'll try to you know,P,Insignificant
if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works ,P,Risk Assessment
has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to,P,Insignificant
get them to leave me alone,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction,P,Insignificant
and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if ,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
it's is trouble it's usually trouble that,P,Insignificant
it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of ,P,Insignificant
so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
uh the last time i argued with somebody,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my,P,Insignificant
whatever comes to your mind,T,Insignificant
uh the last thing i can think of was,P,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature,P,Insignificant
but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like,P,Insignificant
i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that,P,Insignificant
it,P,Insignificant
brings you,P,Insignificant
a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened,P,Insignificant
when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it ,P,Insignificant
and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it,P,Insignificant
but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her,P,Risk Assessment
yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually,P,Risk Assessment
yeah,T,Insignificant
and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care,P,Risk Assessment
but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore,P,Risk Assessment
so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that,P,Current Functional Status
uh huh,T,Insignificant
so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's,P,Insignificant
a dual effort it's very much a dual effort,P,Insignificant
but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but,P,Insignificant
lively discussion <laughter>,P,Insignificant
you know than debate,P,Insignificant
i see,T,Insignificant
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
meh,P,Insignificant
it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you,P,Insignificant
so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy,P,Insignificant
but you deal with it and you you move on,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother,P,Psychosocial History
'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually,P,Psychosocial History
gave me a lot of confidence,P,Psychosocial History
and but were realistic about it,P,Insignificant
so i mean i think i have sort of a,P,Insignificant
realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over,P,Psychosocial History
uh huh,T,Insignificant
and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life,P,Psychosocial History
and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed  ,P,Psychosocial History
that's great,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
my focus was to get her home,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
eating just horrible foods when i did eat,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i'm wondering well if i didn't,P,Insignificant
if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded,P,Insignificant
would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em,P,Insignificant
and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she ,P,Insignificant
uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
her health insurance provider missed that,P,Insignificant
so she wound up having,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
sort of this whole,P,Insignificant
catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down,P,Insignificant
she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her,P,Insignificant
and i know,P,Insignificant
there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her,P,Insignificant
if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah,T,Insignificant
do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself,T,Insignificant
oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's,P,Insignificant
my desire to take responsibility,P,Insignificant
for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really,P,Insignificant
direct them into my own vision because they're their own,P,Insignificant
individual beings,P,Insignificant
and they can't you know,P,Insignificant
be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be,P,Insignificant
but i still have you know my ideals,P,Insignificant
and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too ,P,Insignificant
fit into my life,P,Insignificant
in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings,P,Insignificant
and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs,P,Insignificant
and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but ,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
it's still,P,Insignificant
kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
ten or twenty years ago,P,Insignificant
probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh huh,T,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
i think i i probably would've done that,P,Insignificant
um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate,P,Insignificant
your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family,P,Insignificant
to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself   ,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
ten years ago <laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever served in the military,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i mean it's not,P,Insignificant
i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and of it gets <ge>,P,Insignificant
can you give me an example of that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't,P,Insignificant
but,P,Insignificant
how could i convince myself of that,P,Insignificant
um two weeks after she died i wound up with,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
pulmonary embolisms,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um,P,Insignificant
i mean i wound up having to take more medication,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
because of that,P,Insignificant
uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yeah,T,Insignificant
that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so,P,Insignificant
and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and it,P,Insignificant
it's been,P,Insignificant
a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
just stay in bed and sleep all day you know,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
but then,P,Insignificant
realizing that,P,Insignificant
when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
i took that responsibility of doing it for them,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yeah,T,Insignificant
they didn't you know so,P,Insignificant
they eh they actually got me up and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them,P,Insignificant
if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been,P,Insignificant
you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably ,P,Insignificant
and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for ,P,Insignificant
for me i mean for me making selfish decisions  ,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care  ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but,P,Insignificant
i have a family to look after now ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so i have to go out and do things ,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know  ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm  ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
been working on on a balance of the two,P,Insignificant
how hard is that ,T,Insignificant
very <laughter> but it's worth it,P,Insignificant
i mean ,P,Insignificant
it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter> ,P,Insignificant
but keeping,P,Insignificant
a residence down paying bills things like that ,P,Insignificant
it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that ,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and i and and i know that ,P,Insignificant
but ,P,Insignificant
it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but then ,P,Insignificant
it's like well what's the alternative ,P,Insignificant
i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life ,P,Insignificant
'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna ,P,Insignificant
be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever ,P,Insignificant
and i wouldn't get anything done ,P,Insignificant
i see,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately ,T,Insignificant
uh very ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
anxious and nervous and i mean what if ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i don't find ,P,Insignificant
enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know what what if i can't  ,P,Insignificant
keep,P,Insignificant
a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs ,P,Insignificant
and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that ,P,Insignificant
but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so that's actually ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
a source of ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
anxiety ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but i i i know it it's a cycle,P,Insignificant
that's good ,T,Insignificant
and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
the fundamental thing i need to take of here ,P,Insignificant
i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what,P,Insignificant
is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue ,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
and so ,P,Insignificant
figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again ,P,Insignificant
mm i'll have to ,P,Insignificant
uh ,P,Insignificant
figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you get over it pretty quickly you get through it ,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you felt really happy ,T,Insignificant
the last time i felt really happy,P,Insignificant
i don't know,P,Insignificant
zz,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i ,P,Insignificant
huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me ,P,Insignificant
because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda,P,Insignificant
eh in the middle,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
really like overjoyously happy i don't know ,P,Insignificant
i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened,P,Insignificant
okay ,T,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you ,T,Insignificant
i don't know you don't know ,P,Insignificant
perceptions of other people i mean ,P,Insignificant
probably as somebody who ,P,Insignificant
oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know ,P,Insignificant
handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that  ,P,Insignificant
at all,P,Insignificant
and it's a it,P,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities ,T,Insignificant
probably that i can think on my feet and,P,Psychosocial History
i'm not afraid to ,P,Insignificant
hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done ,P,Psychosocial History
um that ,P,Insignificant
and i can do it creatively and i try to ,P,Insignificant
strive for balance ,P,Psychosocial History
probably ,P,Insignificant
probably the best things about me <laughter> ,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life ,T,Insignificant
that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not ,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to ,P,Psychosocial History
who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got,P,Psychosocial History
a career that she ,P,Insignificant
it's more of a job that she fell into ,P,Insignificant
'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer ,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time  ,P,Insignificant
but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and,P,Insignificant
she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda,P,Insignificant
stole all the money from her business so she lost her business  ,P,Insignificant
and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early ,P,Insignificant
uh oh ,T,Insignificant
she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it  ,P,Insignificant
and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it ,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is ,P,Psychosocial History
yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can ,P,Psychosocial History
be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me ,P,Psychosocial History
people i actually like in my life and ,P,Psychosocial History
be happy with that ,P,Psychosocial History
and i see a lot of people who aren't ,P,Insignificant
and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that ,P,Insignificant
yeah ,T,Insignificant
and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
that's so good to hear ,T,Insignificant
okay i think i've asked everything i need to ,T,Insignificant

thanks for sharing your thoughts with me ,T,Insignificant
thank you <laughter>,P,Insignificant

goodbye,P,Insignificant
