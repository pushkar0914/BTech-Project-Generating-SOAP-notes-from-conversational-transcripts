Hi Ellie!  ,P,Insignificant
Hi! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve been okay. I’ve been trying to practice the reframing and mindfulness exercises.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful to hear! How has that been going for you?  ,T,Insignificant
"I think it’s helped a bit, but I still find myself slipping back into negative thoughts sometimes.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s completely normal. It takes time to build new habits. Can you share a recent experience where you used reframing?  ,T,Insignificant
"Well, I was waiting to hear back from a job application, and I started thinking I wouldn’t get it. But then I reminded myself of what we discussed and reframed it to, “I’ve done my best, and I’ll hear back when I hear back.”  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s an excellent example! How did that make you feel?  ,T,Insignificant
"It made me feel a bit more at ease, actually.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Great! It sounds like you’re making progress. Have you heard back from any jobs yet?  ,T,Insignificant
I did get an interview for one position!  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! How do you feel about it?  ,T,Insignificant
I’m excited but also really nervous.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Those feelings are completely valid. What strategies do you have in mind to manage that nervousness before the interview?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I’ll practice some deep breathing and maybe do a mock interview with a friend.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Those are excellent strategies! Would you like to do a quick mock interview now?  ,T,Insignificant
"Sure, that sounds helpful.  ",P,Insignificant
Alright! Let’s start. Why do you want to work for this company?  ,T,Insignificant
"I admire their commitment to social justice, and I believe my skills in philosophy can contribute to their mission.  ",P,Insignificant
Great answer! What about a weakness you might have?  ,T,Insignificant
"I can be disorganized at times, but I’m working on it by using planners and reminders.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a good way to address it! You’re doing really well. How do you feel now after practicing?  ,T,Insignificant
I feel a bit more confident.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful! Confidence can make a big difference in interviews. Is there anything else you’d like to work on today?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve been thinking about my relationship with my boyfriend.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Okay, what’s been on your mind?  ",T,Insignificant
"I feel like we’re not communicating as well lately, especially about my job search.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Communication is key in any relationship. What specific issues have you noticed?  ,T,Insignificant
"I think he gets frustrated when I talk about my anxiety, and I don’t want to burden him.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you talked to him about how you’re feeling?  ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I just try to keep it to myself.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It might be helpful to express your feelings to him. Would you like to role-play how you might approach that conversation?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yes, that could help.  ",P,Insignificant
"Okay, let’s start. Imagine you’re sitting down with him. What would you say?  ",T,Insignificant
"I’d say, “Hey, I’ve been feeling anxious about my job search, and I want to share that with you, but I don’t want to overwhelm you.”  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great start! How do you think he might respond?  ,T,Insignificant
"I hope he’d be understanding, but I’m not sure.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s good to be honest about your feelings. You might be surprised by his response. Would you like to set a goal to have this conversation before our next session?  ,T,Next Steps
"Yes, I will try to talk to him this week.  ",P,Next Steps
"That’s a positive step! Remember, open communication can strengthen your relationship. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss?  ",T,Insignificant
I think we covered a lot today.  ,P,Insignificant
I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made some great progress. I look forward to hearing about your interview and your conversation with your boyfriend next time.  ,T,Progress Evaluation
