i am,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
so how are you doing today,T,Insignificant
i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee,P,Mental Health Observations: Physiological Observations
and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today,P,Current Functional Status
that's good,T,Insignificant
where are you from originally,T,Insignificant
i was born and raised in los angeles,P,Psychosocial History
and i'm one of the few locals from around here,P,Psychosocial History
and uh i went to school away and uh,P,Insignificant
but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles,P,Psychosocial History
really,T,Insignificant
yes i am,P,Insignificant
what are some things you really like about l_a,T,Insignificant
i like the weather,P,Psychosocial History
having owned a vacation house in another state,P,Psychosocial History
that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here,P,Psychosocial History
um i like the culture i like the diversity,P,Psychosocial History
i like the familiarity,P,Psychosocial History
i like that beaches,P,Psychosocial History
uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert,P,Psychosocial History
but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that,P,Psychosocial History
and uh i think it's a great place to live,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
what are some things you don't really like about l_a,T,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
more of some maybe some of the,P,Insignificant
things i don't like about l_a or say california in general,P,Psychosocial History
say like the high tax rate,P,Psychosocial History
which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now,P,Psychosocial History
which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations,P,Psychosocial History
i'm a small business owner,P,Psychosocial History
so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated,P,Psychosocial History
and uh that's a big problem here in uh,P,Psychosocial History
uh california,P,Psychosocial History
that sucks,T,Insignificant
it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh,P,Psychosocial History
also uh,P,Insignificant
you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't,P,Psychosocial History
see that but it's a big tax on the social service system,P,Psychosocial History
and that's what makes our taxes,P,Psychosocial History
uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of,P,Psychosocial History
mm,T,Insignificant
so that's,P,Insignificant
you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot,T,Insignificant
i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries,P,Psychosocial History
and uh,P,Insignificant
i don't travel as much as i used to,P,Psychosocial History
but i've traveled quite a bit,P,Psychosocial History
and i've learned a couple of languages and uh,P,Psychosocial History
i served,P,Insignificant
like what,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry,P,Insignificant
like what,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
i didn't really understand uh your question,P,Insignificant
when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and,P,Insignificant
i've been all through europe eastern europe,P,Psychosocial History
asia,P,Psychosocial History
south america,P,Psychosocial History
north africa,P,Psychosocial History
um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf,P,Physiological Observations
'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up,P,Psychosocial History
and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga,P,Psychosocial History
and work out and uh,P,Psychosocial History
i try to eat healthy and uh,P,Psychosocial History
that's a big part of my life,P,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
oh,P,Insignificant
sure,P,Psychosocial History
um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span,P,Psychosocial History
but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times,P,Psychosocial History
we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local,P,Psychosocial History
and rented a small flat and,P,Psychosocial History
cooked and did our own shopping but really,P,Psychosocial History
having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days,P,Psychosocial History
it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city,P,Psychosocial History
and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french,P,Psychosocial History
which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger,P,Psychosocial History
my mother insisted that all of us kids,P,Psychosocial History
take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh,P,Psychosocial History
all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school,P,Insignificant
nice,T,Psychosocial History
so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french,P,Insignificant
with the french,P,Psychosocial History
you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
<laughter> so that was a,P,Insignificant
what did you study at school,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i have a few different degrees,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
that was fun,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i also have a masters,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh degree in economics,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i have a degree in crisis management,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
what made you decide to do that,T,Insignificant
uh i found them um,P,Insignificant
interesting,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
it was something that i wanted to do,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports,P,Psychosocial History
and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i originally wanted to be a doctor but,P,Insignificant
once you start going to school,P,Insignificant
for a little bit you change your mind,P,Insignificant
etcetera so,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
are you still working in that,T,Psychosocial History
um i'm actually in the wholesale business now,P,Psychosocial History
for wholesale distributors of furniture products,P,Psychosocial History
and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago,P,Psychosocial History
well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business,P,Insignificant
and it's,P,Psychosocial History
pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it,P,Psychosocial History
but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past,P,Insignificant
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
hm,P,Psychosocial History
actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Psychosocial History
i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter,P,Insignificant
and uh,P,Insignificant
aw,T,Psychosocial History
you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked,P,Psychosocial History
but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids,P,Psychosocial History
you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Psychosocial History
probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun,P,Insignificant
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing,T,Mental Health Observations
uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers,P,Mental Health Observations
but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable,P,Mental Health Observations
i think i'm more of an extrovert,P,Mental Health Observations
whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted,P,Mental Health Observations
but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation,P,Insignificant
and be more um,P,Mental Health Observations
introverted,P,Mental Health Observations
i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh,P,Insignificant
one of my i have uh several computers at home,P,Insignificant
and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well,P,Mental Health Observations: Current Functional Status
i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach,P,Physiological Observations
you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes,P,Physiological Observations
it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years,P,Insignificant
i had,P,Insignificant
it uh,P,Mental Health Observations
i usually find exercise helps me relax the best,P,Mental Health Observations
or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>,P,Insignificant
but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
yes that was uh,P,Insignificant
that was it but,P,Mental Health Observations
that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills,P,Mental Health Observations
i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years,P,Mental Health Observations
i think i've gotten better,P,Insignificant
uh at the,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Mental Health Observations
i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature,P,Insignificant
as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and,P,Insignificant
be a little more,P,Insignificant
how do you had had the skills earlier,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Mental Health Observations
i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know i,P,Mental Health Observations
i am more likely to think before i speak now,P,Mental Health Observations
whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought,P,Insignificant
so i might've said more things that i,P,Insignificant
in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or,P,Insignificant
a work situation,P,Insignificant
um,P,Mental Health Observations
but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it,P,Mental Health Observations
i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
oh wow,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional,P,Insignificant
argument um,P,Insignificant
probably,P,Insignificant
um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter,P,Insignificant
and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting,P,Insignificant
and uh just,P,Insignificant
uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused,P,Insignificant
us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument,P,Insignificant
but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree,P,Insignificant
butt heads,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Mental Health Observations
i felt like i was talking to a wall,P,Mental Health Observations
and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've,P,Insignificant
learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should,P,Insignificant
usually have but you're not really thinking of that because,P,Insignificant
sometimes when we're younger we're,P,Insignificant
looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me,P,Insignificant
but you know,P,Insignificant
i'm pretty easy going and i have,P,Insignificant
different,P,Insignificant
ideas on raising children how she did,P,Insignificant
and that was more,P,Insignificant
not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really,P,Insignificant
discussed those things but it was really just fundamental,P,Insignificant
reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
whereas other things looked good,P,Insignificant
you know on paper to both of us,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
hm,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
there's one recently my father passed away uh recently,P,Insignificant
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and i really only invited very very close friends and family members,P,Insignificant
i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of,P,Insignificant
not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a,P,Insignificant
i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact,P,Insignificant
that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known,P,Insignificant
about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but,P,Insignificant
now as time's passed i wish i'd invited,P,Insignificant
more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends,P,Insignificant
you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just,P,Insignificant
and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because,P,Insignificant
i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but,P,Insignificant
i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little,P,Insignificant
they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that,P,Insignificant
you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less,P,Insignificant
doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really,P,Insignificant
mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so,P,Insignificant
i see,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Psychosocial History
um well both my parents are recently,P,Psychosocial History
uh deceased in the last couple of years,P,Psychosocial History
and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away,P,Psychosocial History
in december,P,Insignificant
and,P,Psychosocial History
we're not super close like i always like i look at other families,P,Psychosocial History
we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting,P,Psychosocial History
i guess we're also uh different,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
and uh,P,Psychosocial History
i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family,P,Psychosocial History
not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that,P,Insignificant
we just,P,Insignificant
never did that because we're all,P,Insignificant
all so uh,P,Psychosocial History
uh different,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but,P,Psychosocial History
you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know,P,Insignificant
but i think every family has their own sort of,P,Insignificant
stuff,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was,P,Insignificant
but i think i function,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years,P,Insignificant
why'd you decide to enlist in the military,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
i didn't enlist i was an officer,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i went to one of the service academies,P,Insignificant
how old were you when you joined the military,T,Insignificant
that,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
um seventeen i started when after high school,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i went to a service academy,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into,P,Insignificant
you were very young weren't you,T,Insignificant
i was but same age as everybody else that went there,P,Insignificant
did you ever see combat,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh we did,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
nineteen eighty three,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled,P,Insignificant
at the time,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and poison gas was sprayed on us,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
wow,T,Insignificant
that was a,P,Insignificant
it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation,P,Insignificant
why,T,Insignificant
that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you,P,Insignificant
you actually play in the game and the same with uh,P,Insignificant
you know if you're in a combat,P,Insignificant
unit,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
how did serving in the military change you,T,Psychosocial History
well it made me more patriotic having grown up,P,Psychosocial History
in california,P,Psychosocial History
whereas people who are from all over the country,P,Psychosocial History
and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did,P,Psychosocial History
never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i,P,Psychosocial History
ended up becoming uh,P,Psychosocial History
just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country,P,Psychosocial History
whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or,P,Psychosocial History
georgia north dakota south dakota montana,P,Insignificant
right,T,Insignificant
grows up with that kind of uh,P,Insignificant
pride so i thought it was good and it,P,Insignificant
unlike so many of my friends that,P,Psychosocial History
they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan,P,Insignificant
what did you do after the military,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i got two graduate degrees,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i went to work in private enterprise,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
didn't care for it,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic,P,Insignificant
for a number of years and,P,Psychosocial History
then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell,P,Insignificant
how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked,P,Insignificant
and again i was an officer,P,Insignificant
uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile,P,Insignificant
to be able to come back to los angeles,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
because it was just so uh,P,Insignificant
so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality,P,Insignificant
so but,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
it was a great experience,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um,P,Physiological Observations
it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late,P,Physiological Observations
and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well,P,Physiological Observations
even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um,P,Physiological Observations
but i generally sleep uh,P,Physiological Observations
i generally sleep pretty well,P,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Mental Health Observations
i feel pretty good lately,P,Mental Health Observations
you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but,P,Mental Health Observations
boy the last few months i feel great pretty much,P,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
no not really,P,Mental Health Observations
i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
it wasn't,P,Insignificant
anything real too debilitating,P,Insignificant
and i wasn't able to really function,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling,P,Insignificant
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
i do i was really against it in the past,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past,P,Insignificant
i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it,P,Insignificant
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about,P,Psychosocial History
life relationships,P,Insignificant
and sometimes it's good talking things out with a,P,Insignificant
a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and,P,Insignificant
i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that,P,Insignificant
do you still go to therapy now,T,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i do have someone that i go to,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
how has seeing a therapist affected you,T,Mental Health Observations
i think it's nice,P,Insignificant
you know they really,P,Insignificant
if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped,P,Insignificant
they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's,P,Insignificant
always in the past they just help you talk through your,P,Insignificant
your thoughts,P,Insignificant
and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
to the situation that's why i like,P,Insignificant
talking to someone who has a lot more life experience,P,Mental Health Observations
and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
so but it's,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and,P,Insignificant
was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you,P,Insignificant
but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Mental Health Observations
uh this morning,P,Insignificant
i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and,P,Mental Health Observations
family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather,P,Current Functional Status
and i have a bunch of errands to run,P,Mental Health Observations
and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out,P,Mental Health Observations
and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold,P,Insignificant
where i always i know that term so,P,Mental Health Observations
but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
and i looked forward to feeling the sun,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Psychosocial History
uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects,P,Insignificant
i'm too smart for my own good,P,Insignificant
and i'm a,P,Insignificant
i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational,P,Psychosocial History
i'm very resourceful,P,Psychosocial History
people always call me when they have issues,P,Psychosocial History
and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go,P,Psychosocial History
whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or,P,Insignificant
you know i'm great with medical diagnoses,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Psychosocial History
and uh,P,Insignificant
you know people also say i'm a lot of fun,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
i'm fun to be with,P,Psychosocial History
and um,P,Insignificant
i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white,P,Insignificant
i am what i am,P,Insignificant
i don't b_s,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
i'm the opposite of a politician,P,Insignificant
so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
so that's pretty much,P,Mental Health Observations
has that gotten you in trouble,T,Insignificant
no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
i like to think i do,P,Insignificant
