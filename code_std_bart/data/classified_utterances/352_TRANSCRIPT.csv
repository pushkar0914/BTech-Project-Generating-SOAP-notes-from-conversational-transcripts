um,P,Insignificant
it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like,P,Mental Health Observations

do you travel a lot,T,Insignificant
yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go,P,Psychosocial History

what do you enjoy about traveling ,T,Insignificant
uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um,P,Psychosocial History
because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's,P,Insignificant
all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the,P,Insignificant

i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah  ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep ,T,Insignificant
lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep,P,Physiological Observations
or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Physiological Observations
what are you like when you don't sleep well ,T,Insignificant
i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function ,P,Physiological Observations
how have you been feeling lately ,T,Insignificant
i've been feeling really good um ,P,Current Functional Status
over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately ,T,Insignificant
um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more ,P,Progress Evaluation
positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to,P,Insignificant
kind of,P,Insignificant
just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more,P,Progress Evaluation
confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>   ,P,Progress Evaluation
when was the last time you felt really happy ,T,Insignificant
oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um ,P,Insignificant
i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and,P,Insignificant
it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and,P,Insignificant
um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just,P,Insignificant
like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> ,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you ,T,Insignificant
my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and,P,Psychosocial History
bold and fearless um,P,Psychosocial History
that i'm unique,P,Psychosocial History
and artistic,P,Psychosocial History
and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter> ,P,Psychosocial History
what are you most proud of in your life ,T,Insignificant
um ,P,Insignificant
probably,P,Insignificant
just like,P,Insignificant
the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very,P,Psychosocial History
exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and,P,Psychosocial History
i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and,P,Psychosocial History
i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles ,P,Psychosocial History
is there anything you regret ,T,Insignificant
oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so,P,Psychosocial History
i wouldn't really change anything ,P,Psychosocial History
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ,T,Insignificant
oh <sigh>,P,Insignificant
i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i ,P,Insignificant
should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because,P,Mental Health Observations
um,P,Insignificant
i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just,P,Mental Health Observations
tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do ,P,Mental Health Observations
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed ,T,Insignificant
oh ,P,Insignificant
let's see that's kind of hard <laughter> ,P,Insignificant
um oh i guess,P,Insignificant
i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since,P,Psychosocial History
i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so,P,Insignificant
um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun ,P,Psychosocial History
