i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you,P,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
i'm great thanks,T,Insignificant
where are you from originally,T,Insignificant
uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley,P,Psychosocial History
really,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
what are some things you really like about l_a,T,Insignificant
uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um,P,Insignificant
the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um,P,Insignificant
camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like,P,Insignificant
eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that,P,Insignificant
that i i i would say i like that too,P,Insignificant
cool,T,Insignificant
what are some things you don't really like about l_a,T,Insignificant
<laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath>,P,Insignificant
uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um,P,Insignificant
and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know,P,Insignificant
that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but,P,Insignificant
that's fine,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter>,P,Insignificant
i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow,P,Insignificant
make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but,P,Insignificant
that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if,P,Insignificant
if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things,P,Insignificant
and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun,P,Insignificant
what do you enjoy about traveling,T,Insignificant
well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be,P,Insignificant
eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um,P,Insignificant
i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also,P,Insignificant
fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great,P,Insignificant
i'd love to hear about one of your trips,T,Insignificant
uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last,P,Insignificant
trip i i,P,Insignificant
took um,P,Insignificant
lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um,P,Insignificant
well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um,P,Insignificant
austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um,P,Insignificant
like,P,Insignificant
tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life,P,Insignificant
i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and,P,Insignificant
so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my,P,Insignificant
my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to,P,Insignificant
traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and,P,Insignificant
it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it,P,Insignificant
awesome,T,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so,P,Insignificant
i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like,P,Insignificant
familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um,P,Insignificant
maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh,P,Insignificant
like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that,P,Insignificant
uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really,P,Insignificant
relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and,P,Insignificant
i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax,P,Insignificant
uh huh,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh>,P,Insignificant
i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about,P,Insignificant
things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um,P,Insignificant
really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't,P,Insignificant
sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um,P,Insignificant
i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not,P,Presenting Problem / Chief Complaint
even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or,P,Insignificant
running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait,P,Insignificant
waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
um <sigh> hmm,P,Insignificant
um nothing immediately comes to mind i,P,Insignificant
well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh,P,Trauma History
was um,P,Insignificant
driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow,P,Trauma History
rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like,P,Trauma History
reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but,P,Trauma History
it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they,P,Trauma History
you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um,P,Trauma History
<deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened,P,Trauma History
yeah,T,Insignificant
that sucks,T,Insignificant
it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh,P,Physiological Observations
i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up,P,Physiological Observations
'til one or two every night uh and,P,Physiological Observations
it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were,P,Physiological Observations
more um,P,Insignificant
able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven,P,Physiological Observations
mhm,T,Insignificant
and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to,P,Insignificant
going to sleep later and waking up later,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh,P,Psychosocial History
um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
in my life uh yeah like i said i,P,Insignificant
i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i,P,Insignificant
there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh,P,Substance Use History
i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we,P,Substance Use History
we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life,P,Substance Use History
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
i would say that um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
it's important to,P,Insignificant
to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um,P,Insignificant
recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from,P,Insignificant
the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um,P,Insignificant
kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which,P,Insignificant
eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um,P,Insignificant
that approach it's kinda fatalistic,P,Insignificant
and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that,P,Insignificant
it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of,P,Insignificant
you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
well i <sigh>,P,Insignificant
i i guess when people i i don't especially um,P,Insignificant
take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that,P,Insignificant
so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is,P,Insignificant
uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized,P,Insignificant
i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should,P,Insignificant
when was the last time that happened,T,Insignificant
uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody,P,Insignificant
just out of uh college you know um,P,Insignificant
went over what we had done and,P,Insignificant
you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and,P,Insignificant
i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh,P,Insignificant
it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um,P,Insignificant
i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh,P,Insignificant
not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of,P,Insignificant
you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that,P,Insignificant
the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but,P,Insignificant
you know it wasn't our call <sigh>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences,T,Insignificant
mm most memorable experiences um,P,Insignificant
well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um,P,Insignificant
the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um,P,Insignificant
for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest,P,Insignificant
period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i,P,Insignificant
i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um,P,Insignificant
and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun,P,Insignificant
nice,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we,P,Psychosocial History
aw,T,Insignificant
we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty,P,Psychosocial History
happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been,P,Psychosocial History
very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,P,Insignificant
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
yeah thank you <laughter>,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um,P,Insignificant
sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh,P,Insignificant
you know um,P,Insignificant
helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh>,P,Insignificant
intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh,P,Insignificant
(laughter,T,Insignificant
i,P,Insignificant
what else i think that um my best friend might say that,P,Insignificant
uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i,P,Insignificant
also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um,P,Insignificant
hmm <tisk>,P,Insignificant
well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that,P,Psychosocial History
um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um,P,Psychosocial History
my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh,P,Psychosocial History
i'd say maybe the fact that,P,Insignificant
it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
no problem have a good day thank you,P,Insignificant
