That sounds wonderful! Did you find it relaxing?  ,T,Insignificant
Totally! I really got to disconnect from everything. I even tried surfing!  ,P,Insignificant
"Wow, that’s impressive! How did that go?  ",T,Insignificant
"It was challenging but fun! I fell a lot, but I think I got the hang of it by the end of the trip.  ",P,Insignificant
That’s great to hear! Trying new things can be so rewarding. Did you feel any different when you returned?  ,T,Insignificant

What do you mean by reality?  ,T,Insignificant
"Just the job search and feeling stuck again. It’s like, I was so free there, and now I’m back to stressing about money and work.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s understandable to feel that way. Do you have any strategies to cope with that stress?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to keep up with my workouts and photography, but it’s hard when I feel overwhelmed.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That makes sense. How do you feel about incorporating more of those activities into your routine?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I need to make it a priority. It just gets hard to motivate myself when I feel down.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Perhaps we can set some small, achievable goals for you to help with that?  ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’d like that.  ",P,Insignificant

"Yeah, I think so too.  ",P,Insignificant
How about your roommates? Have you had a chance to reconnect with them since your last session?  ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I’ve been so busy with work and trying to get back into a routine that I haven’t made an effort.  ,P,Psychosocial History
Would it be helpful to reach out to them? Maybe suggest a fun activity?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I should. It would be nice to break the ice again.  ",P,Insignificant
What kind of activity do you think would work?  ,T,Insignificant
Maybe a movie night or a game night? Something low-key.  ,P,Insignificant
That sounds perfect! It could help you all reconnect and lighten the mood.  ,T,Insignificant
I’ll try to set that up soon.  ,P,Insignificant
Excellent! How have you been feeling about your job search?  ,T,Insignificant
"Honestly, it’s been frustrating. I apply to jobs but don’t hear back, and it just makes me feel like I’m not good enough.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s tough out there, and it’s easy to internalize those rejections. Have you thought about what you want from your next job?  ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, definitely something more creative and engaging. I want to feel like I’m making a difference, not just sitting at a desk.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a good insight. Maybe we can brainstorm some job options that align with those values?  ,T,Insignificant
I’d like that.  ,P,Insignificant
Great! What about photography? Have you thought about pursuing it more seriously?  ,T,Insignificant
"I have, but it feels so daunting. Like, I don’t know where to start.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What if we break it down into smaller steps?  ,T,Insignificant
"Okay, like what?  ",P,Insignificant
Maybe start by creating a portfolio of your best work or reaching out to local photographers for advice?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
That could work! I’ll feel more confident if I have something to show.  ,P,Insignificant
Exactly! And it could open up new opportunities for you.  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I like that idea.  ",P,Insignificant
How’s your relationship with your boyfriend? Have things improved since we last talked?  ,T,Insignificant
"A little. We had a good conversation after I got back, but we still have our moments.  ",P,Psychosocial History
Communication is key. Have you both been able to express your feelings openly?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, we’ve been trying. It’s just hard sometimes when we get caught up in our own frustrations.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s completely normal. It might help to schedule regular check-ins, just to talk about how you’re both feeling.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a good idea! I think it would help us stay connected.  ,P,Insignificant
"I’m glad you think so! Remember, it’s okay to lean on each other during tough times.  ",T,Insignificant
"I will. Thanks, Ellie.  ",P,Insignificant
