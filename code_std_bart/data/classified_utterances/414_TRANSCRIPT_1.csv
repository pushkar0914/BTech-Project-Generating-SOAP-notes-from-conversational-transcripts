Hi again! It’s good to see you. How have you been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"Hey! I’ve been okay, I guess. Just the usual ups and downs, you know?",P,Insignificant
"I understand. Last time we talked about some tough experiences, especially regarding your mental health. Have there been any significant changes or challenges since then?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Well, I’ve been trying to focus more on my sleep, but it’s still really hard. I had a couple of nights where I barely slept.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI): Physiological Observations
That sounds frustrating. Have you been able to try any strategies to help with your sleep?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I’ve been trying to limit screen time before bed, but sometimes I get caught up in watching shows. It’s like I can’t help myself.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common struggle. It can be tough to break that habit. Have you noticed if certain shows affect your sleep differently than others?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Yeah, definitely. If I watch something intense or scary, I’ll have nightmares. But if it’s something light-hearted, I usually sleep better.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI): Physiological Observations
That’s a good insight. Maybe you could create a list of shows that help you relax before bed. Would you be open to trying that?,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, I think that could help. I just need to remember to stick to it.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
"It’s all about creating a routine. Speaking of routines, how have you been managing your emotions since we last spoke?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I’ve been trying to be more aware of when I’m getting upset. I think I’m getting better at it, but it’s still a work in progress.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a positive step. Have there been any specific situations where you felt you managed your emotions well?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Actually, yeah! I had a disagreement with a classmate about a project, and instead of blowing up, I just took a deep breath and talked it out.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’re developing better communication skills. How did that make you feel afterward?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I felt relieved. It’s nice to know I can handle things without getting too emotional.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a significant achievement. It’s important to celebrate those small victories. Have you been able to talk to Ryan since our last session?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I have! We talked things over, and it felt good. We’re still not back to where we were, but it’s a start.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s great to hear. What do you think helped facilitate that conversation?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I think just being honest about how much I missed him and how I wanted to work things out. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Honesty can be a powerful tool in relationships. Are there any strategies you think you could use to maintain that openness moving forward?,T,Next Steps
Maybe setting aside time to talk regularly? Like a check-in or something.,P,Next Steps
"That sounds like a solid plan. Regular communication can definitely help strengthen your friendship. On another note, how has your therapy been going with your new therapist?",T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s okay. I feel like I’m still getting used to her style. It’s different from my previous therapist.,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
That’s understandable. Sometimes it takes time to adjust to a new therapist. Have you shared your feelings about that with her?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Not yet. I’m not sure how to bring it up without sounding rude.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s perfectly valid to express your needs in therapy. You might say something like, “I appreciate your help, but I’m finding it a bit different than what I’m used to.” ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That makes sense. I’ll try to bring it up next time.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Good! Remember, therapy is a partnership, and your feedback is important. How about your creative pursuits? Have you had a chance to work on any film projects or comedic ideas?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve been brainstorming some ideas for short films, but I haven’t started anything yet. Just been a bit stuck, I guess.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s normal to feel stuck sometimes. What do you think is holding you back from starting?,T,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I think it’s fear of not being good enough or not getting it right. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a common fear, especially in creative fields. Would it help to set small, manageable goals for yourself to ease into it?",T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Yeah, that might work. Like maybe just writing down ideas without judging them?",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Exactly! Allow yourself the freedom to create without pressure. You can always refine your ideas later. ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
I like that idea. I’ll try to do that this week.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Great! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next session. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?,T,Insignificant
I think that covers it. I feel a bit lighter just talking about everything.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s okay to reach out and share your feelings. I’m here for you. ",T,Insignificant
"Thanks, Ellie. I appreciate it.",P,Insignificant
You’re welcome! Let’s set a goal for next time. Maybe focus on your sleep routine and creative writing?,T,Next Steps
Sounds good to me!,P,Next Steps
Perfect! I’ll see you next week. Take care!,T,Insignificant
"Bye, Ellie! See you!",P,Insignificant
