"It's still a challenge. I went for a couple of walks, but I find it hard to motivate myself to go regularly.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s understandable. Sometimes it takes a little push to get back into a habit. Have you thought about setting smaller, more achievable goals for yourself?",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’ve been thinking about just starting with short walks, maybe 15-20 minutes a day, instead of trying to do longer hikes right away.",P,Next Steps

I find it hard sometimes. I don't want to seem like I'm struggling.,P,Risk Assessment

Great! Let’s also revisit that dream you mentioned in our last session. Have you had it again since then?,T,Insignificant
I did have it again last week. It was frustrating because it felt so real.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I can see why that would be distressing. Have you noticed any specific triggers that might lead to that dream?,T,Insignificant
"Not really, but I’ve been feeling more anxious about work, so maybe that’s contributing.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s quite possible. Sometimes our subconscious reflects our waking anxieties. It might be worth exploring those feelings further. ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think I need to. I don’t want that dream to keep bothering me.",P,Next Steps
Absolutely. Would you like to work on some techniques to address that anxiety before it manifests in your dreams?,T,Insignificant
