Sometimes I get stuck on ideas or feel overwhelmed by the pressure to create something good.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I see. It’s common for writers to feel that way. Have you tried any techniques to help with that pressure?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried free-writing before, which helps, but I don’t always remember to do it.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions

"That’s good to hear. It’s important to acknowledge stress, but also to recognize how you’re handling it.  ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I try to keep things in perspective.  ",P,Insignificant
That’s a healthy approach. You mentioned feeling remorseful about past interactions before. Have any memories come up since we last spoke?  ,T,Insignificant
"A few, but I’ve been trying to let them go.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a positive mindset. Letting go can be challenging. What strategies do you use to help with that?  ,T,Insignificant
I try to remind myself that I can’t change the past and focus on the present instead.  ,P,Psychosocial History

"Yes, I think that would help. Maybe I could do it a couple of times a week.  ",P,Next Steps
That sounds like a good plan! How about we aim for two sessions a week to start?  ,T,Next Steps
"Okay, I can do that.  ",P,Next Steps
Great! Let’s discuss how that goes next time. Is there anything else on your mind today?  ,T,Insignificant
"Not really, just trying to stay focused on my writing and life.  ",P,Insignificant
"That’s a healthy focus. Remember, it’s okay to seek support when needed, especially with writing, which can be quite personal.  ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind.  ",P,Insignificant
I’m glad to hear that. I think we’ve covered a lot today. Let’s recap: you’ll work on free-writing for ten minutes a day and practice mindfulness twice a week.  ,T,Next Steps
