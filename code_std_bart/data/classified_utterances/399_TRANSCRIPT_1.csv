"Hi, it's Ellie again. I'm glad to see you back today. How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"I've been okay, I guess. A mix of ups and downs, like I mentioned last time.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds familiar. Have there been any particular moments that stood out to you in the past week?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, actually. I had a really good day with friends, but then I also had a rough day where I felt really low.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the low day?,T,Insignificant
"Um, I just felt really unmotivated. I didn't want to do anything, and I ended up just sitting around all day.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
What do you think triggered that feeling?,T,Insignificant
I think it was just a lot of pressure from school and feeling like I'm not doing enough.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds tough. How do you usually cope with that kind of pressure?,T,Insignificant
"I try to write or play music, but sometimes I just end up shutting down.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It makes sense that when you're feeling overwhelmed, it can be hard to engage in those activities that usually help. Have you tried any specific strategies when you feel that way?",T,Insignificant
Not really. I just kind of let it pass.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Would you be open to exploring some coping techniques together today?,T,Insignificant
"Sure, I’d be interested in that.",P,Insignificant
Great! One technique we can try is mindfulness. Have you ever practiced mindfulness or meditation before?,T,Insignificant
"I've heard of it, but I haven't really tried it.",P,Insignificant
Mindfulness can help you stay grounded and manage those overwhelming feelings. Would you like to try a short exercise with me now?,T,Insignificant
"Okay, I’m willing to give it a shot.",P,Insignificant
Awesome. Let’s start by taking a deep breath in together... and out. Focus on the sensation of your breath. What do you notice?,T,Insignificant
"I feel a little more relaxed, actually.",P,Mental Health Observations
That’s great to hear! The goal is to bring your attention back to your breath whenever your mind starts to wander. How do you feel about practicing this a few times a week?,T,Insignificant
I think I could try that.,P,Next Steps
"Perfect. It can be a simple five-minute exercise. Now, thinking about your feelings of pressure, can you identify any specific areas where you feel you’re not doing enough?",T,Insignificant
Mostly in school. I feel like I should be getting better grades or doing more extracurricular activities.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It sounds like you have high expectations for yourself. What do you think drives those expectations?,T,Insignificant
I guess I just want to prove to myself and my family that I can succeed.,P,Psychosocial History
That’s understandable. Do you feel like those expectations are realistic?,T,Insignificant
"Sometimes I feel like they’re too high, but then I also feel guilty for not meeting them.",P,Risk Assessment
It's common to feel that way. It might be helpful to reframe those expectations. What would it look like to set more achievable goals for yourself?,T,Insignificant
Maybe just focusing on one assignment at a time instead of trying to do everything at once.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a constructive approach. How would you feel about setting a specific goal for this week related to your studies?,T,Insignificant
I could aim to finish my essay by the end of the week instead of stressing about all my assignments.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a solid plan. How can you hold yourself accountable for that goal?,T,Insignificant
"I could tell my friends about it, so they can check in on me.",P,Next Steps
That’s a great idea! Sharing your goals with others can provide additional motivation. How do you feel about your relationships with your friends?,T,Insignificant
"They’re pretty good. They understand me, and I can talk to them about stuff.",P,Psychosocial History
That's wonderful. It sounds like you have a supportive network. Have you talked to them about how you’ve been feeling lately?,T,Insignificant
Not really. I tend to keep that stuff to myself.,P,Psychosocial History
Would you feel comfortable sharing your feelings with a close friend?,T,Insignificant
I think I could try. It might help to talk about it.,P,Next Steps
Absolutely. Opening up can often lighten the burden. What else do you think might help you navigate these ups and downs?,T,Insignificant
Maybe just being kinder to myself when I feel low instead of pushing myself to be okay.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a powerful insight. Self-compassion can be a game changer. How can you practice that self-kindness this week?,T,Insignificant
I could remind myself that it’s okay to have bad days and that I don’t have to be perfect.,P,Next Steps
Exactly. It’s all part of being human. I’m really proud of you for recognizing that. Let’s check in on this in our next session. Does that sound good?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you, Ellie.",P,Insignificant
