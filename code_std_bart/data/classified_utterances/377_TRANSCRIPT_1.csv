"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been okay, I guess. A bit overwhelmed still, but managing.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"A little bit. I’ve been trying to focus on what I can control, but it’s still tough.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a positive step. What specific things have you been focusing on?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been trying to set small goals for myself each day, like going for a walk or reading a chapter of a book. It helps to feel a sense of accomplishment.",P,Current Functional Status

"It feels good! Even if it’s just a small thing, it gives me a little boost. But then I still have those moments where I feel overwhelmed by everything else.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s completely normal to have mixed feelings. The small victories can help counterbalance the larger stressors. Have you noticed any patterns in your feelings of overwhelm?,T,Insignificant

"I tend to push it down and just keep going, but I know that’s not healthy.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Acknowledging that is a great first step. What if you allowed yourself to feel that guilt without judgment? What might that look like?,T,Insignificant
I guess I’d just sit with it for a bit and recognize that it’s okay to feel that way.,P,Insignificant

"Yeah, they’ve been pretty intense lately. I wake up feeling anxious.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s tough. Sometimes our dreams can reflect our subconscious worries. Have you noticed any themes in those dreams?,T,Insignificant
A lot of them are about feeling unprepared or out of control. Like I’m in a situation where I can’t find my way.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

"I think it relates to my job situation. I feel like I'm not where I want to be, and it’s frustrating.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI):Psychosocial History
"It’s understandable to feel that way, especially during transitions. What steps can you take to feel more prepared in your career?",T,Insignificant
I could look into some online courses or networking events. I’ve been avoiding those because I’m not sure where to start.,P,Next Steps
