well i can think of um there's probably a million situations that i would've <laughter> i wish i would've handled differently i can't think of one in particular,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant

um,P,Insignificant
i didn't marry the girl that i think that i should have married,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

that's a big one for me,P,Insignificant
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
yeah well,P,Insignificant
we <w> we were together for about four years,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and uh i think i just took her for granted and i just didn't uh commit,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and um,P,Insignificant
that was a long time ago and now that's it's been so many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that,P,Insignificant
that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but because,P,Insignificant
my selfishness and because i just uh,P,Insignificant
had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh,P,Insignificant
i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was,P,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend,P,Psychosocial History
as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh,P,Insignificant
how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't,P,Psychosocial History
i never feel like i can help anyone,P,Psychosocial History
who i know who has a problem so,P,Insignificant
when was the last time that happened,T,Insignificant
oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone,P,Psychosocial History
all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't,P,Insignificant
feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know,P,Psychosocial History
mhm,T,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
well they're um,P,Insignificant
it's very distant it's it's just,P,Psychosocial History
it's very cordial and it's very uh,P,Insignificant
uh i don't know what the word is it's on the,P,Insignificant
it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all,P,Psychosocial History
and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense,P,Psychosocial History
so,P,Insignificant
yeah it's it's,P,Insignificant

it does bother me that mine is that way,P,Psychosocial History
yeah,T,Insignificant

have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
no not not really i would say,P,Insignificant
they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so,P,Insignificant
even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and,P,Insignificant
no i don't think i've i've changed much,P,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
mm pretty down,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
but like i said,P,Insignificant
in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again,P,Insignificant
i've always been this way so,P,Insignificant
it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how long ago were you diagnosed,T,Insignificant
a long,P,Insignificant
oh a long time ago i was um,P,Insignificant
about ten years old or,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
around there about,P,Insignificant
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
uh i was just missing a lot of school,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to,P,Insignificant
to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
it went from there,P,Insignificant
do you still go to therapy now,T,Insignificant
no i haven't gone to therapy,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
since i was a teenager,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
why did you stop,T,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
i didn't feel it was helping me at all,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
so,P,Insignificant
one day i just,P,Insignificant
decided i didn't wanna go anymore,P,Insignificant
eh,P,Insignificant
how has seeing a therapist affected you,T,Insignificant
uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um,P,Medical and Psychiatric History

nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that we should've,P,Insignificant
gotten married,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
