it was just recently um actually unfortunately,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it was last week and it was with my husband,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and um,P,Insignificant
it was about um,P,Insignificant
just the way he responds sometimes to me,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh it can be a little aggressive,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah that was it,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
i felt,P,Insignificant
very frustrated,P,Mental Health Observations
um and i actually felt angered too um,P,Mental Health Observations
but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so,P,Mental Health Observations
it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time,P,Mental Health Observations
yeah,T,Insignificant
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently,T,Insignificant
uh <sigh>,P,Insignificant
a situation which i wish i would've handled differently,P,Insignificant
honestly i haven't had a situation like that in,P,Insignificant
in years i've pretty much kind of,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
you know kind of mastered,P,Insignificant
my responses um,P,Insignificant
to certain um,P,Insignificant
stimuli,P,Insignificant
i've kinda got that down,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,T,Insignificant
the hardest decision i've ever had to make,P,Insignificant
well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage,P,Trauma History
um mother,P,Trauma History
i was pregnant at sixteen and,P,Trauma History
um i had um,P,Insignificant
a lot of pressure from family to um,P,Trauma History
give my child up for adoption or to,P,Trauma History
um abort,P,Trauma History
and i chose life so that was,P,Trauma History
that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old,P,Trauma History
teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager,P,Trauma History
or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so,P,Trauma History
that i think was the hardest decision,P,Trauma History
i had to make,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
pro-choice pro-life and um,P,Insignificant
eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom,P,Insignificant
aw,T,Insignificant
i do yeah,P,Insignificant
do you find it easy to be a parent,T,Insignificant
um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um just as anything,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
but at the end of the day it is really rewarding,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised,P,Insignificant
become a productive citizen and go out into society and,P,Insignificant
just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is,P,Insignificant
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents,T,Insignificant
oh wow,P,Insignificant
so many ways um,P,Insignificant
the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um,P,Current Functional Status
accept his feedback even if i don't like it,P,Current Functional Status
and i um allow him to express his self,P,Current Functional Status
fortunately unfortunately when i was little um,P,Insignificant
there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child,P,Insignificant
um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it,P,Insignificant
um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self,P,Current Functional Status
i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age,P,Current Functional Status
and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um,P,Insignificant
make sure that you nurture that um because that's,P,Insignificant
kind of um,P,Insignificant
the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite,P,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
well,P,Insignificant
it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up,P,Physiological Observations
so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that,P,Insignificant
it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away,P,Physiological Observations
and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so,P,Physiological Observations
it varies,P,Physiological Observations
how have you been feeling lately,T,Insignificant
i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um,P,Mental Health Observations
i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but,P,Mental Health Observations
other than that i i've been feeling really good,P,Mental Health Observations
okay,T,Insignificant

no i haven't,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
no i have not,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up,P,Mental Health Observations
i'm happy because,P,Insignificant
that is a chance for me to,P,Insignificant
take advantage carpe diem seize the day,P,Insignificant
so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because,P,Mental Health Observations
i realize that some people did not wake up,P,Insignificant
some people are homeless some people,P,Insignificant
are going through so many situations that are really disheartening,P,Insignificant
and that's not me so,P,Insignificant
i feel really really blessed,P,Mental Health Observations
every day,P,Insignificant

thank you,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
um as um,P,Insignificant
nurturing patient loving,P,Mental Health Observations
friendly,P,Mental Health Observations
um,P,Insignificant
kind of reserved,P,Mental Health Observations
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my master's degree,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
in certain subjects,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things,P,Insignificant
and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert,P,Mental Health Observations
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
you know what no regrets no regrets um,P,Insignificant
you live and learn um nothing is perfect,P,Insignificant
um everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today,P,Insignificant
so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person that i am today,P,Mental Health Observations
mhm,T,Insignificant
