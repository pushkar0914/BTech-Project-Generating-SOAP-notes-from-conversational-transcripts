Hi there! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?  ,T,Insignificant
"Hey, Ellie! I’ve been okay. I tried that wind-down routine you suggested.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful! How did it go for you?  ,T,Insignificant
"It was good! I read before bed instead of scrolling through my phone, and I think I slept a bit better.  ",P,Physiological Observations
That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like a positive change. Did you notice any other changes in your mood or energy levels?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I felt a bit less anxious in the mornings. I think it helped to not be on my phone right before bed.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s great feedback! It’s amazing how small changes can lead to significant improvements. Have you continued practicing mindfulness as well?  ,T,Insignificant
I have! I try to do it every morning when I wake up.  ,P,Current Functional Status
That’s excellent! How does starting your day with mindfulness feel for you?  ,T,Insignificant
It feels calming. I think it helps set a better tone for the day.  ,P,Physiological Observations
I’m so glad to hear that. It sounds like you’re making meaningful strides in managing your anxiety. Have you encountered any challenges while implementing these techniques?  ,T,Insignificant
"Well, there are days when I forget to do them, and I feel guilty about it.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s completely normal to have those moments. Remember, progress isn’t linear. It’s okay to miss a day. What’s important is that you’re trying.  ",T,Insignificant
That makes sense. I guess I shouldn’t be so hard on myself.  ,P,Insignificant
"Exactly! Self-compassion is key in this journey. Speaking of challenges, how has your temper been lately?  ",T,Insignificant
I think it’s improved a bit. I’ve been trying to take a step back when I feel angry.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great strategy! What techniques have you been using to manage your anger?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve been practicing deep breathing and counting to ten before reacting.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s an excellent approach. It gives you a moment to pause and reflect before responding. Have you noticed any specific situations where this has helped?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I had a disagreement with a coworker last week, and I used the breathing technique. It helped me stay calm.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
That’s a significant achievement! It sounds like you’re learning to respond rather than react.  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, it felt good to handle it better than before.  ",P,Progress Evaluation
I’m proud of you for that progress! Are there any specific triggers that you’re still struggling with?  ,T,Insignificant
"I think when I feel overwhelmed with tasks, that’s when I’m more likely to get angry.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Overwhelm can be a significant trigger. Have you thought about ways to manage your workload?  ,T,Insignificant
I’ve been trying to prioritize tasks and break them down into smaller steps.  ,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a great strategy! It can make tasks feel more manageable. How has that been working for you?  ,T,Insignificant
"It’s been helping a bit. I still struggle with procrastination, though.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Procrastination is a common challenge. What do you think leads to that for you?  ,T,Insignificant
I think it’s a mix of fear of failure and just feeling overwhelmed.  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"That’s a valid concern. Sometimes, the fear of not doing something perfectly can hold us back. Would you like to explore ways to tackle that fear?  ",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I think that would be helpful.  ",P,Insignificant
"One technique is to reframe your perspective on failure. Instead of seeing it as a negative, think of it as an opportunity for growth.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a good way to look at it.  ,P,Insignificant
"Another approach is to set realistic expectations. Remember, it’s okay to make mistakes. They’re part of the learning process.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
I like that idea. I think I need to remind myself of that more often.  ,P,Insignificant
Absolutely! Let’s set a goal for you to practice this reframing technique over the next week. How does that sound?  ,T,Next Steps
Sounds good! I’ll work on it.  ,P,Next Steps
"Wonderful! As we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss?  ",T,Insignificant
I think I’m good for now. I feel like I have a plan to work on.  ,P,Current Functional Status
