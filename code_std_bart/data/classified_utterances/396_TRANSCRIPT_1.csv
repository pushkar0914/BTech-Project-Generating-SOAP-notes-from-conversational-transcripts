"Hi, welcome back! How have you been since our last session?  ",T,Insignificant
"I've been okay, just dealing with some family stuff.  ",P,Psychosocial History
I remember you mentioned your mother-in-law is unwell. How has that been for you?  ,T,Insignificant
"It's been really tough. We spent a lot of time at the hospital, and it’s just draining.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds exhausting. Have you had a chance to take care of yourself during this time?  ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I've been focused on supporting my wife and her family.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s understandable. Supporting others can sometimes come at the expense of our own needs. What do you think you need right now?  ,T,Insignificant
I don’t know… maybe just some time to breathe.  ,P,Insignificant
That’s a good start. Have you been able to find any moments for yourself?  ,T,Insignificant
"A little, like when I take a walk or go for a hike. It helps clear my mind.  ",P,Physiological Observations
That’s great to hear. Nature can be very healing. How does it feel to be out there?  ,T,Insignificant
It feels refreshing. It’s like I can forget everything for a moment.  ,P,Mental Health Observations
That’s important. Have you noticed any changes in your mood when you’re outside versus when you’re at home?  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I feel lighter when I’m outside. Inside, it’s just… heavy.  ",P,Mental Health Observations
It’s interesting how environment can affect our emotions. Would you be open to setting a goal to spend more time outdoors this week?  ,T,Insignificant
I think I could do that. I’ll try to go hiking at least twice.  ,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a solid plan. Let’s check in on that next time. How about your sleep? Have you been able to rest?  ,T,Insignificant
Not really. It’s been hard to sleep with everything going on.  ,P,Physiological Observations
Sleep can be significantly impacted by stress. Have you tried any techniques to help with that?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve tried some breathing exercises, but it’s tough to quiet my mind.  ",P,Therapeutic Interventions
Breathing exercises can be helpful. Would you like to try a short mindfulness exercise together now?  ,T,Therapeutic Interventions
"Sure, that sounds good.  ",P,Insignificant
"Okay, let’s take a deep breath in… and out. Focus on the sensation of your breath.  ",T,Therapeutic Interventions
<breathes>  ,P,Insignificant
"Good. Now, picture a place where you feel safe and happy. Can you describe it?  ",T,Insignificant
I’m imagining a quiet forest with soft sunlight filtering through the trees.  ,P,Insignificant
That sounds beautiful. How does being in that space make you feel?  ,T,Insignificant
It makes me feel calm and peaceful.  ,P,Mental Health Observations
"Excellent. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, remember that space and try to visualize it.  ",T,Insignificant
I’ll try to remember that.  ,P,Insignificant
Great. Let’s also talk about your back injury. How has that been affecting you lately?  ,T,Insignificant
"It’s still bothering me. I can’t do as much as I’d like, and it’s frustrating.  ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That frustration is valid. Have you considered any physical therapy or exercises that might help?  ,T,Insignificant
"I’ve thought about it, but I’m not sure where to start.  ",P,Insignificant
How about we set a goal to research some options this week? You could look into local physical therapists or online resources.  ,T,Next Steps
That sounds doable. I’ll look into it.  ,P,Next Steps
Good. It’s a step towards regaining some control over your physical health.  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I hope it helps.  ",P,Insignificant
Is there anything else on your mind today?  ,T,Insignificant
Just a lot of worry about my wife and her family.  ,P,Psychosocial History
That’s understandable. It’s hard to see loved ones in pain. Have you talked to her about how you’re feeling?  ,T,Insignificant
Not really. I don’t want to add to her stress.  ,P,Insignificant
It might help to share your feelings with her. It can strengthen your connection during this tough time.  ,T,Insignificant
I guess I’ll try to talk to her about it.  ,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a good idea. Communication is key in supporting each other.  ,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I’ll work on that.  ",P,Next Steps
Great! Let’s plan to discuss how that conversation goes in our next session.  ,T,Next Steps
"Okay, sounds good.  ",P,Insignificant
"Thank you for sharing today. Remember to take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your hikes and your conversation with your wife next time.  ",T,Insignificant
"Thanks, Ellie. I appreciate it.  ",P,Insignificant
"You’re welcome! Take care, and see you soon.  ",T,Insignificant
Bye!  ,P,Insignificant
