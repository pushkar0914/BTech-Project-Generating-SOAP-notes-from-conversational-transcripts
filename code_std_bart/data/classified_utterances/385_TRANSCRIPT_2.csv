Hi! Welcome back! How have things been since our last session?,T,Insignificant
"It’s been okay. I reached out to my friends, but we haven’t made plans yet.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a good step! Just reaching out is progress in itself. How did it feel to take that step?,T,Insignificant
"It felt a bit weird, but okay. ",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s completely normal. It can feel strange to reconnect. Have you had any thoughts about what you’d like to do when you do get together?,T,Insignificant
I think I want to play basketball.,P,Psychosocial History
That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you feel excited about the possibility of playing?,T,Insignificant
A little. I hope they want to.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"It’s great to have hope! If they don’t want to play, what’s another option you might suggest?",T,Insignificant
Maybe just hanging out somewhere?,P,Psychosocial History
Absolutely! It’s all about finding what works for everyone. Let’s talk about how you can approach that conversation. How would you feel about suggesting a few options?,T,Insignificant
I can do that.,P,Insignificant
"Fantastic! Now, shifting gears a bit, have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels since we last spoke?",T,Physiological Observations
I think I feel a bit better. ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful to hear! What do you think contributed to that improvement?,T,Insignificant
Maybe just talking about things? ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Definitely! Talking things out can be very therapeutic. Have you had any new experiences or reflections that helped?,T,Insignificant
I’ve been trying to focus on what makes me happy.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a great strategy! Can you share some of those things that bring you happiness?,T,Insignificant
I guess playing basketball and hanging out with friends.,P,Psychosocial History
Those are excellent sources of joy! It sounds like social connections and physical activity are important for your well-being. How can you incorporate more of those into your routine?,T,Insignificant
I could try to play basketball more often.,P,Next Steps
That sounds like a great plan! How often do you think you could realistically play?,T,Insignificant
Maybe once a week?,P,Next Steps
"That’s a solid goal! Setting that intention can help create a positive routine. Now, let’s talk about those feelings of frustration you mentioned last time. Have you encountered any situations that triggered those feelings again?",T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I saw someone being rude in public.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s definitely frustrating. How did you handle that situation?,T,Insignificant
I just ignored it.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
"Ignoring it can be a way to cope. But sometimes, it can also help to express those feelings. What would you say to that person if you could?",T,Insignificant
I’d tell them to be nicer.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a strong response. It shows you value kindness. Would you feel comfortable expressing that in a constructive way in the future?,T,Insignificant
Maybe. I don’t want to confront anyone.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Confrontation can be difficult. Perhaps you could practice self-assertiveness in smaller situations first. Would that feel more comfortable?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, that might work.",P,Therapeutic Interventions
"Great! We can work on some techniques for that. As we wrap up today, let’s set a focus for the week. You’ll aim to play basketball once a week and practice expressing your feelings in smaller situations. How does that sound?",T,Next Steps
Sounds good.,P,Insignificant
I’m proud of the progress you’re making! I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care!,T,Insignificant
You too. Bye!,P,Insignificant
