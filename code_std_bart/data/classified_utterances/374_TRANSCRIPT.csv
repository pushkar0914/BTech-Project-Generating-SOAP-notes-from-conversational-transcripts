it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that made it kind of,P,Insignificant
um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

and um,P,Insignificant
just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of,P,Insignificant
what um,P,Insignificant
i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um you know full time,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant

what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting,P,Insignificant
um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good,P,Insignificant
place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a,P,Insignificant
like room to to grow and advance and all that,P,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant

favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
and we just spent like,P,Insignificant
we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing,P,Psychosocial History
and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like,P,Insignificant
we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of,P,Insignificant
it hit all of the,P,Insignificant
you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also,P,Insignificant
i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything,P,Psychosocial History
awesome,T,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
what do i do to relax um,P,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
if i'm home i might just like,P,Insignificant
you know,P,Insignificant
throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like,P,Insignificant
sort of escape relief,P,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
um pretty good i don't i mean,P,Insignificant

<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath>,P,Insignificant
how did you feel in that moment,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was,P,Insignificant
like judging me unfairly,P,Insignificant
and that was upsetting,P,Insignificant
that sucks,T,Insignificant
yeah <laughter>,P,Insignificant
tell me about your relationship with your family,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to,P,Psychosocial History

my parents are really supportive <sigh> um,P,Psychosocial History
they are,P,Insignificant
you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time,P,Psychosocial History
um so i'd say we have a pretty,P,Insignificant
pretty good relationship,P,Psychosocial History
that's good,T,Insignificant
what's something you feel guilty about,T,Insignificant
<deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth>,P,Insignificant
i guess because i'm like in this,P,Insignificant
sort of job hunting,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like,P,Insignificant
doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've,P,Insignificant
sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle>,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i see,T,Insignificant
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
<deep breath> um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good,P,Physiological Observations
why,T,Insignificant
i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out,P,Insignificant
but um i've just had more,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
like nights where,P,Insignificant
it either,P,Insignificant
takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason,P,Physiological Observations
um,P,Insignificant
i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know,P,Physiological Observations
are they triggered by something,T,Insignificant
not that i have been able to identify,P,Insignificant
i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
in flux but,P,Insignificant
i i don't know there was no like event,P,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
what are you like when you don't sleep well,T,Insignificant
cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good,P,Physiological Observations
feeling,P,Insignificant
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
i understand,T,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
not really no,P,Insignificant
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how long ago were you diagnosed,T,Insignificant
<deep breath>,P,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
like <sigh>,P,Insignificant
i think in like,P,Insignificant
october or november,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
many many years ago <sniffle>,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what got you to seek help,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i felt like i was,P,Insignificant
a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
<sniffle>,P,Insignificant
what were your symptoms,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
just having a hard time,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
functioning on the most basic,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
level like just,P,Insignificant
getting up and,P,Insignificant
taking a shower,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and like going to the grocery store,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and you know,P,Insignificant
answering emails was just like,P,Insignificant
it took so much energy,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
so yeah i just i wasn't  really,P,Insignificant
functioning normally,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
that sounds really hard,T,Insignificant
 yeah,P,Insignificant
do you still go to therapy now,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
do you feel like therapy is useful,T,Insignificant
yes um,P,Insignificant
<laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so,P,Insignificant
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy,T,Insignificant
<deep breath> i think that therapy,P,Insignificant
is good for me because it,P,Insignificant
helps me focus on,P,Insignificant
my sort of patterns um,P,Insignificant
and also like,P,Insignificant
ah,P,Insignificant
just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
kind of just reacting to situations i'm like,P,Insignificant
mm,P,Insignificant
just like noticing more what is going on um,P,Insignificant
and it just helps to,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
<deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um,P,Insignificant
i don't know um,P,Insignificant
i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um,P,Insignificant
eh maybe over uh,P,Insignificant
over christmas being at home with my family,P,Psychosocial History
can you tell me about that,T,Insignificant
yeah,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well it just was,P,Insignificant
that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and um,P,Insignificant
like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of,P,Insignificant
feeling,P,Insignificant
not,P,Insignificant
<laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
so when i was there with them it just um,P,Insignificant
it just felt very like,P,Insignificant
safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know,P,Insignificant
warm familial embrace,P,Insignificant
aw,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
<laughter>,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
um <sigh>,P,Insignificant
<laughter> i think she would describe me as,P,Insignificant
funny,P,Psychosocial History
and smart,P,Psychosocial History
and,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
a good listener,P,Psychosocial History
nonjudgmental,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter>,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,T,Insignificant
<deep breath> hmm <sigh>,P,Insignificant
okay um,P,Insignificant
so,P,Insignificant
this happened,P,Insignificant
the the last like,P,Insignificant
job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like,P,Insignificant
a year and a half close to two years and uh,P,Insignificant
i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat>,P,Insignificant
he sort of out of nowhere,P,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um,P,Insignificant
essentially like,P,Insignificant
the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project,P,Insignificant
so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah,P,Insignificant
and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer,P,Insignificant
and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how,P,Insignificant
he,P,Insignificant
i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know,P,Insignificant
even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore,P,Insignificant
he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic,P,Insignificant
decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me,P,Insignificant
but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic,P,Insignificant
yada yada so,P,Insignificant
to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me,P,Insignificant
um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point,P,Insignificant
he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me,P,Insignificant
and later on like a couple of months down the road,P,Insignificant
i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still,P,Insignificant
ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um,P,Insignificant
this guy who,P,Insignificant
had worked with us a bunch kind of like,P,Insignificant
if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff,P,Insignificant
he was doing my job so,P,Insignificant
oh no,T,Insignificant
yeah so it just like,P,Insignificant
it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like,P,Insignificant
that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like,P,Insignificant
in a way that's like,P,Insignificant
that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like,P,Insignificant
angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter>,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
<deep breath> um <sigh> let's see,P,Insignificant
i um,P,Insignificant
a very loyal person <deep breath> um,P,Insignificant
i am,P,Insignificant
smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um,P,Insignificant
very like caring kind,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i'm conscientious,P,Insignificant
and i work hard <sniffle>,P,Insignificant
that's great,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
<laughter> uh,P,Insignificant
man,P,Insignificant
i think,P,Insignificant
to uh,P,Insignificant
be more confident,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
less passive,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
to really,P,Insignificant
like focus on,P,Insignificant
what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle>,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
hmm <sigh> um,P,Insignificant
probably just some of the,P,Insignificant
relationships that i formed with people,P,Psychosocial History
um,P,Insignificant
just like really,P,Insignificant
you know deep friendships,P,Psychosocial History
okay i think i have asked everything i need to,T,Insignificant
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me,T,Insignificant
you're welcome,P,Insignificant
goodbye,T,Insignificant
bye,P,Insignificant
