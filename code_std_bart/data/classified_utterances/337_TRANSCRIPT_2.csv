"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing a bit better. I reached out to a couple of people in the industry.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! How did it go?,T,Insignificant
Surprisingly well! One of them responded and invited me to a small gathering of performers next week.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s wonderful news! How does that make you feel?,T,Insignificant
"Honestly, I’m excited but also a bit anxious about meeting new people.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. What strategies do you think might help you manage that anxiety when you’re at the gathering?,T,Insignificant
I could use the breathing exercises we practiced. Maybe I’ll also remind myself that everyone there has been in my shoes before.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
Those are excellent strategies! Focusing on common ground can help ease the pressure. What are you most looking forward to about the gathering?,T,Insignificant
I’m looking forward to hearing about what other performers are doing and hopefully getting some advice.,P,Insignificant
That’s a great mindset! It sounds like you’re ready to learn and connect. ,T,Insignificant
I hope so!,P,Insignificant
You are! Let’s also touch on your work at the call center. How have things been there since we last spoke?,T,Insignificant
"It’s been a bit less hectic, thankfully. I’ve been trying to apply the mindfulness techniques.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI): Current Functional Status
That’s great to hear! How have they been working for you?,T,Insignificant

"Yeah, it really is. ",P,Insignificant
Are there any other areas of your life where you’d like to apply that same mindset?,T,Insignificant
I think I need to apply it to my creative work too. I often feel like everything has to be perfect before I share it.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a common struggle for many creative individuals. What if you allowed yourself to share something that isn’t perfect?,T,Insignificant
"That sounds scary, but I think it could be freeing.",P,Insignificant
"It can be! Maybe you could set a goal to share a piece of work with someone, even if it’s not finished.",T,Next Steps
