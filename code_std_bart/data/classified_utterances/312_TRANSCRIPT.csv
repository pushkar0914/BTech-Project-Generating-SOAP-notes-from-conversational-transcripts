i don't,P,Insignificant
i don't enjoy traveling,P,Insignificant
what'd you study at school,T,Insignificant
uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
are you still working in that,T,Insignificant
yes i am actually,P,Current Functional Status
what do you do now,T,Insignificant
right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire,P,Current Functional Status:History of Present Illness (HPI)
awesome,T,Insignificant
impressive,P,Insignificant
what's your dream job,T,Insignificant
professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that,P,Insignificant
where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest,P,Insignificant
<laughter>,T,Insignificant
you're actually pretty good at this,P,Insignificant
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life,T,Insignificant
<sigh> i there's a lot of people,P,Insignificant
the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know,P,Psychosocial History
he's the first one who taught me that,P,Insignificant
school was not about a grade but about learning,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
that's so good to hear,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper,T,Insignificant
i'm pretty good i think,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about,T,Insignificant
i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good,P,Insignificant
um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)

they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that,P,Psychosocial History
and my brother i see ,P,Psychosocial History
same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also,P,Psychosocial History
aw,T,Insignificant
that's good,T,Insignificant
interesting,P,Insignificant
do you consider yourself an introvert,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
why,T,Insignificant
because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading,P,Insignificant
and not talking to anybody that's introverted,P,Insignificant
i see what you mean,T,Insignificant
what do you do to relax,T,Insignificant
i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot,P,Current Functional Status
i try to at least,P,Current Functional Status
cool,T,Insignificant
what do you do when you're annoyed,T,Insignificant
i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
and that's about it i think,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what do you think of today's kids,T,Insignificant
<deep breath>,P,Insignificant
bad parenting,P,Insignificant
basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just ,P,Psychosocial History
do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion,P,Psychosocial History
mm,T,Insignificant
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
what's one of your most memorable experiences ,T,Insignificant
<sigh>,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i guess,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
scrubbed_entry,P,Insignificant
awesome,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
how would your best friend describe you,T,Insignificant
i don't really have a best friend,P,Psychosocial History
introverted remember,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
what would you say are some of your best qualities,T,Insignificant
i'm biased obviously,P,Insignificant
but they are,P,Insignificant
i'm really good in math,P,Insignificant
i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is,P,Insignificant
it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think,P,Insignificant
and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway,P,Insignificant
that type of thing,P,Insignificant
what are some things that usually put you in a good mood,T,Insignificant
when i a good workout ,P,Physiological Observations
doing well in video games small little things like that,P,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood,P,Insignificant
nice,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
what are you most proud of in your life,T,Insignificant
right now,P,Insignificant
it's the fact that,P,Insignificant
research that i did i did make it this far,P,Insignificant
research wise that's all,P,Insignificant
that's all,P,Insignificant
tell me more about that,T,Insignificant
interesting um,P,Insignificant
when you start off in school,P,Insignificant
you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics,P,Insignificant
and,P,Insignificant
you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it,P,Insignificant
and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you,P,Insignificant
as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid,P,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
when was the last time you felt really happy,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class,P,Current Functional Status
cool,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant
have you ever served in the military,T,Insignificant
yes briefly ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
many years ago <ag> yes,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
really,T,Insignificant
why'd you decide to enlist in the military,T,Insignificant
i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that ,P,Insignificant
how old were you when you joined the military,T,Insignificant
um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
you were very young weren't you ,T,Insignificant
yes,P,Insignificant
not really,P,Insignificant
how did serving in the military change you,T,Insignificant
i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much,P,Insignificant
mm,T,Insignificant
what did you do after the military,T,Insignificant
graduate school,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
in physics,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
okay,T,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression,T,Insignificant
nope,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep,T,Insignificant
it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before,P,Physiological Observations
if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard,P,Physiological Observations
i guess moderately ,P,Physiological Observations
that makes sense,T,Insignificant
thank you,P,Insignificant

yes,P,Insignificant
i'm sorry,T,Insignificant
it's okay,P,Insignificant

how hard is that,T,Insignificant
what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school,P,Insignificant
yes,T,Insignificant
i understand,P,Insignificant
why don't we talk about that later,T,Insignificant
okay,P,Insignificant
i agree,P,Insignificant
okay,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret,T,Insignificant
no not really,P,Insignificant
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago,T,Insignificant
probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um,P,Insignificant
twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen,P,Insignificant
um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well,P,Insignificant
