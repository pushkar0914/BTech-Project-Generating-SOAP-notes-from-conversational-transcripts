"Hi, welcome back! How have you been since our last session?",T,Insignificant
"Hey, thanks! I've been okay, just trying to process everything we talked about last time.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That's good to hear. What stands out to you the most from our last conversation?,T,Insignificant
I think the part about my music and how I feel about it. I realized I have a lot of expectations and pressure on myself.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s a significant insight. Can you elaborate on those expectations?,T,Insignificant
"Well, I feel like I have to be successful right away, or else I’m wasting my time. I put a lot of pressure on myself to make it big.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That sounds quite stressful. What do you think contributes to that pressure?,T,Insignificant
I guess it’s a mix of wanting to prove myself and the fear of disappointing my family. They have their own ideas of what success looks like.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
I see. Balancing your aspirations with family expectations can be tough. How do you usually cope with that pressure?,T,Insignificant
"I try to distract myself with music or meditation, but sometimes it just feels overwhelming.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Have you noticed any specific situations that trigger that overwhelming feeling?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, when I think about my future, like what I’m going to do next or if I’ll ever get to where I want to be.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s understandable. Future uncertainties can create anxiety. Have you tried any specific techniques to manage that anxiety?,T,Insignificant
"I’ve been doing some mindfulness exercises, but I still find it hard to stay focused. My mind wanders a lot.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Mindfulness can take time to develop. Would you be open to trying some grounding techniques together?,T,Insignificant
"Sure, I’d like that.",P,Insignificant
Great! Let’s start with a simple exercise. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in... hold it for a moment... and now exhale slowly. How does that feel?,T,Insignificant
"It feels calming, actually. I think I needed that.",P,Mental Health Observations
Good! You can use that technique whenever you feel overwhelmed. What else might help you feel more grounded?,T,Insignificant
Maybe writing down my thoughts? I used to keep a journal.,P,Therapeutic Interventions
That’s a wonderful idea! Journaling can help you process your feelings and thoughts. Would you be willing to commit to writing a little each day?,T,Next Steps
"Yeah, I think I can do that. It might help clear my mind.",P,Next Steps
Excellent! Let’s aim for a few minutes each day. How about we check in on this in our next session?,T,Next Steps
Sounds like a plan!,P,Insignificant
"Now, regarding your music, have you made any progress or changes since we last spoke?",T,Insignificant
"I’ve been working on some new songs, feeling a bit more inspired lately. It’s like I’m channeling my feelings into my music.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
That’s fantastic! Channeling emotions into creativity can be very therapeutic. How does that make you feel?,T,Insignificant
It feels good! It’s like I’m releasing some of that pressure. But then I worry if it’s good enough.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
It’s common to doubt our creative work. Do you find that those doubts affect your motivation?,T,Insignificant
"Sometimes, yeah. I’ll start a project and then get discouraged and abandon it.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
How about we explore those doubts? What specifically makes you feel like it’s not good enough?,T,Insignificant
"I guess I compare myself to others a lot. I see other musicians who are more successful, and I feel like I’m falling behind.",P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Comparison can be a thief of joy. What would happen if you focused on your unique journey instead?,T,Insignificant
I think I’d feel less stressed. I just need to remind myself that everyone has their own timeline.,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
Absolutely! It’s important to honor your path. Would you like to set a goal around that for the next week?,T,Insignificant
"Yeah, I could try to limit my social media time. That might help with the comparisons.",P,Next Steps
That sounds like a great plan. How much time do you think you’d like to limit yourself to?,T,Insignificant
Maybe just 30 minutes a day? I’ll try to focus on creating instead.,P,Next Steps
Perfect! Let’s touch base on how that goes in our next session. Is there anything else you want to discuss today?,T,Insignificant
I think that covers it. I feel a bit lighter after talking about it.,P,Mental Health Observations
"I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s a process, and you’re doing great. I look forward to hearing how your journaling and music go next time.",T,Insignificant
"Thanks, Ellie. I appreciate it.",P,Insignificant
"You’re welcome! Take care, and see you soon.",T,Insignificant
Bye!,P,Insignificant
