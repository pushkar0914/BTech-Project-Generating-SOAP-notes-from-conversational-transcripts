<ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was,P,Psychosocial History
or am and they're um,P,Insignificant
i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up,P,Psychosocial History

uh go on a walk or,P,Current Functional Status

and uh,P,Insignificant
what are some things that make you really mad,T,Insignificant
um well ,P,Insignificant
there's some <so> some,P,Insignificant
uh ,P,Insignificant
there's some kind of uh ,P,Insignificant
injustices that happen in not,P,Insignificant
not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking,P,Psychosocial History
eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna ,P,Insignificant
oh ,T,Insignificant
uh make any exceptions or change some rules ,P,Insignificant
and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups>,P,Psychosocial History
uh that are upsetting,P,Insignificant
can you give me an example of that ,T,Insignificant
uh yeah,P,Insignificant
i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site  ,P,Psychosocial History
the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside ,P,Psychosocial History
and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside,P,Psychosocial History
um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained,P,Psychosocial History
that we were late setting up when it when they told us,P,Psychosocial History
to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and ,P,Psychosocial History
and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so,P,Psychosocial History
uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job ,P,Psychosocial History
oh no,T,Insignificant
that's yeah that's how they do things,P,Psychosocial History
so that that is upsetting ,P,Insignificant
how do you cope with them ,T,Insignificant
uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are,P,Current Functional Status
that might be better,P,Insignificant
um ,P,Insignificant
that's good ,T,Insignificant
yeah ,P,Insignificant
how are you at controlling your temper ,T,Insignificant
uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx,P,Current Functional Status
might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that,P,Current Functional Status
but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that ,P,Current Functional Status
mhm,T,Insignificant
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about ,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we,P,Psychosocial History
we were arguing where to go first ,P,Psychosocial History
and um so we compromised and,P,Insignificant
did most of her things and one of my things then after ,P,Insignificant
this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so,P,Insignificant
but it,P,Insignificant
that's good ,T,Insignificant
yeah ,P,Insignificant
have you ever served in the military ,T,Insignificant
no,P,Insignificant
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d,T,Insignificant
post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is ,P,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
uh,P,Insignificant
no i have not,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
have you been diagnosed with depression ,T,Insignificant
yes ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
how long ago were you diagnosed ,T,Insignificant
oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
that's a long time ,T,Insignificant
yeah ,P,Insignificant
what got you to seek help ,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what were your symptoms ,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um i was waking up at,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um,P,Insignificant
focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah ,T,Insignificant
did you think you had a problem before you found out ,T,Insignificant
yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
do you still go to therapy now ,T,Insignificant
no,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
why did you stop ,T,Insignificant
uh well,P,Insignificant
eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy,T,Insignificant
um,P,Insignificant
i think therapy makes you see what the um ,P,Insignificant
like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really,P,Insignificant
you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of,P,Insignificant
try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately ,P,Insignificant
or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint,P,Insignificant
and i try to look for clues about that  ,P,Insignificant
that makes sense ,T,Insignificant
mhm,T,Insignificant
how have you been feeling lately ,T,Insignificant
i think i'm um,P,Insignificant
slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
it um,P,Insignificant
yeah ,T,Insignificant
it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and,P,Insignificant
deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed  ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
uh huh,T,Insignificant
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately ,T,Insignificant
uh ,P,Insignificant
well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
um,P,Insignificant
soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
mm,P,Insignificant
you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
yeah ,T,Insignificant
eh things like that or um,P,Insignificant
some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that ,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that ,P,Insignificant
okay ,T,Insignificant
yeah,T,Insignificant
is there anything you regret ,T,Insignificant
oh you mean in life in general yeah well,P,Insignificant
i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa>,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well,P,History of Present Illness (HPI)
and um didn't really,P,Insignificant
i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
hmm,T,Insignificant
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ,T,Insignificant
um ,P,Insignificant
i think it would've been to um ,P,Insignificant
at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
i had i was an art major and i had no car so  ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to  ,P,Medical and Psychiatric History
do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time,P,Insignificant
uh huh ,T,Insignificant
