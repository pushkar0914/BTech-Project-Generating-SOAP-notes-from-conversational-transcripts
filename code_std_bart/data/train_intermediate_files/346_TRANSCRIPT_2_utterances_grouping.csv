History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I’ve been okay. I tried to do some journaling like we talked about.   It was a little hard at first, but once I got into it, I found it helpful.   I wrote about that anxious day I mentioned last time and how I felt afterward.   It felt like I was releasing some of the weight. I could see my feelings more clearly.   Excellent! Have you had any moments since our last session where you felt overwhelmed?   Actually, yes. I had an audition last week, and I was really anxious leading up to it.   I felt nervous, but I think I did okay. I just reminded myself that it was practice.   I felt relieved but also a bit down because I didn’t get a callback.   I tried to distract myself and went out with friends, but I still felt a bit off.   I did, actually. I wrote about my disappointment and how it’s hard not to take it personally.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I tried to use the breathing exercises you taught me, and it helped a bit.   I did a few breathing exercises, and I think they helped.  "
Next Steps,"Maybe I could list out my accomplishments or positive feedback I’ve received.   That’s a great idea! Keeping a list of affirmations can help counter negative thoughts. Would you like to start that?   Yes, I think I will.   I think I’m okay for now. I just want to keep working on these tools.  "
