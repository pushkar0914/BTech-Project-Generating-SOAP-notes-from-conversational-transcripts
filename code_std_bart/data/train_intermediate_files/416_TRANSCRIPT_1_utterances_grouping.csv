History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's understandable. Last time, we talked a bit about your feelings of motivation and how you sometimes feel you settle for less. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke? Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I guess I just feel stuck sometimes. Like, I want to do more, but I don't know where to start. It’s great that you’re reflecting on that. What do you think is holding you back from starting? I think it’s a mix of fear and just feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes I don’t even know what I want to do. Excellent! I’d love to hear what you come up with. Last time, we also talked about your relationship with your ex-girlfriend. How have you been feeling about that situation since we last spoke? It’s been okay. I still think about her sometimes, but I’m trying to move on."

Physiological Observations,"Great! It might help you feel less isolated. Speaking of feelings, how have you been sleeping lately? Pretty well, actually. I’ve been trying to keep a regular schedule. That’s wonderful to hear! A regular sleep schedule can really impact your mood and energy levels. Have you noticed any changes in your mood with better sleep? Yeah, I feel more focused during the day. It’s nice not to feel so groggy."

Progress Evaluation,"That’s a significant improvement! It sounds like you’re making some positive changes. How do you feel about your progress so far? I feel okay about it. I still wish I could do more, but I guess it’s a start."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s a positive step. Have you found any coping strategies that help you when you think about her? I’ve been trying to distract myself with movies and hanging out with friends. That helps a bit. That’s a good approach. Staying connected with friends can provide support. Have you had any conversations with them about how you’re feeling? It’s understandable to feel that way, but friends often appreciate being let in. Sharing can strengthen those relationships. Would you be open to discussing your feelings with them more? Yeah, I think I could try that."
Next Steps,"That makes sense. It can be really daunting to figure out what you want, especially when there are so many options. Have you considered trying to set smaller goals to help clarify what you want? Focusing on smaller, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment. What’s one small step you think you could take toward figuring things out? Maybe just making a list of things I’m interested in? That seems manageable. That’s a great idea! Writing things down can often help clarify your thoughts. Would you be willing to share that list in our next session? Sure, I can do that. Absolutely, every small step counts. It’s all about progress, not perfection. What do you think you’ll focus on this week as we prepare for our next session? I’ll work on that list of interests and maybe talk to a friend about how I’ve been feeling. That sounds like a solid plan. Remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate these feelings. It’s okay to take your time."
