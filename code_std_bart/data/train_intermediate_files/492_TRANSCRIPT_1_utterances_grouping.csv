History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's great to hear! Last time, we talked about your experiences in L.A. and some of your work-related challenges. Have there been any updates on those fronts? Yes, actually. I had a conversation with the woman from church about the meeting situation. I pointed out the micromanagement issue, and she was receptive. It felt good to express my concerns. I think I could be more assertive with my family. Sometimes, I feel like they don’t take my opinions seriously. Yes, there’s a family gathering coming up. I often feel sidelined during discussions. I’ve been thinking a lot about my career change. I’m excited about pursuing a business degree, but I also feel a bit anxious about it. I worry about whether I’ll be successful in a business environment. I’ve been in healthcare for so long."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Great! One approach is to use ""I"" statements. For example, instead of saying, ""You never listen to me,"" you could say, ""I feel unheard when my opinions aren't acknowledged."" "
Next Steps,"I could try to share my thoughts more openly and use those ""I"" statements when I feel dismissed. I could keep a list of my accomplishments and skills handy. That way, I can refer to it when I doubt myself. Yes! I’d like to research some programs and maybe reach out to someone in the field to ask about their experience."
