I feel a mix of happiness and sadness, but it’s nice to remember her in a positive light. Yes, actually. I had a presentation at work, and I felt really nervous leading up to it. I think it’s the constant deadlines and the fear of not meeting expectations."

Surprisingly well! I think my preparation paid off. Yeah, it felt good to succeed at something I was worried about. Yes, we had a meeting, and she was really understanding.

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to use the deep breathing techniques more, especially when I feel overwhelmed. I tried to practice deep breathing and remind myself that I was prepared.
