History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay, but I feel like I’m struggling a bit more with anxiety lately.   I’m sorry to hear that. Can you share what’s been triggering your anxiety?   Just thinking about the baby coming and whether I’ll be able to handle everything.   That’s a big life change. It’s natural to feel anxious. Have you been able to practice the breathing exercises we discussed?   That’s great! Have you noticed any changes when you use the technique?   I feel a bit more relaxed, but the anxiety comes back quickly.   That’s common. It’s important to remember that managing anxiety is a process. Have you found any other coping strategies that work for you?   Great! Now, let’s discuss how you can prepare for the baby. Are there specific worries you have?   I’m worried about finances and whether we’ll have enough saved up.   Financial concerns are common for new parents. Have you created a budget or savings plan?   Not really. I’ve just been trying to save when I can.   How do you feel about discussing your feelings of inadequacy as a provider?   I feel like I should be doing more, but I’m not sure how.  "

Next Steps,"It can be challenging, but prioritizing that time can strengthen your relationship. Would you like to set a goal for a date night?   That sounds good. Maybe next weekend?   Perfect! How do you feel about planning that together?   I think it would be fun.   Let’s set that as a goal for this week. You could schedule a time with your wife to go over it.   I can do that.   It’s important to recognize that you’re already doing a lot by being proactive and involved. Can you identify any small steps you could take to feel more secure?   Maybe looking for freelance work or side projects in advertising.   That’s a great idea! Exploring additional income sources can alleviate some pressure. Have you thought about what kind of projects you’d like to pursue?   I’d love to work on some golf-related advertising projects.   That aligns with your dream job! How can you start reaching out to potential clients or networks in that area?   I could update my portfolio and reach out to some contacts I have.   That sounds like a solid plan. Let’s set a goal for you to reach out to at least two contacts this week.   I can do that.  "
