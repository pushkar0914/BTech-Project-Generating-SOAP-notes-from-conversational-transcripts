History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear! Last time, we talked a bit about your temper and some of the things you'd like to change about yourself, like being more outgoing. Have you thought about that since we last spoke? Yeah, I have actually. I’ve been trying to be a bit more social lately. I went to a small gathering with friends. It was fun! I talked to a few new people, but I still felt a bit shy at times. I think it’s just my nature. I worry about saying the wrong thing or not being interesting enough. Actually, yes! I had a small argument with my sister again, but I took a moment to breathe before responding, and it helped a lot. Sometimes I doubt my ideas or worry that they won’t be well-received. I feel a bit nervous, but I think it’s worth a try."
