History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. Last time, you mentioned feeling a bit mellow but also some underlying sadness. Have those feelings changed at all? Yeah, a little. I still feel mellow, but there are moments when I feel a bit more down. It’s like a wave, I guess. That makes sense. Can you tell me about a specific moment when you felt that wave of sadness? Well, the other day I was out for a walk, and I saw a couple holding hands. It hit me that I’m still single, and I felt really lonely. Not really. I don’t want to burden my friends with my stuff. I just keep it to myself. Maybe. I just worry they won’t understand or will think I’m being too dramatic. Wonderful! Let me know how it goes. Now, you mentioned wanting a girlfriend last time. Have you thought more about what that would look like for you? Yeah, I think about it often. I’d like someone to share experiences with, but I feel like I’m not really putting myself out there. I guess I’m afraid of rejection. It’s easier to just stay in my comfort zone. I feel a bit nervous but also a little excited, I guess."

Physiological Observations,"That sounds like a good start. Shifting gears a bit, how has your sleep been since we last spoke? Any improvements? Not really. I still wake up a lot during the night. Sometimes I just lie there thinking too much."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s understandable. Would you be open to trying a mindfulness exercise, like deep breathing or guided imagery, before sleep? I could give that a shot. I’ve heard it helps. Great! Let’s try this: Spend a few minutes focusing on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. "
Next Steps,"It’s common to have those worries. But often, friends appreciate honesty and might surprise you with their support. Would you consider trying to share with one friend this week? I guess I could try. There’s one friend I feel a bit closer to.  Okay, I’ll try that tonight. That’s a valid concern. Maybe we can work on some small steps to gradually expand that comfort zone. Would you be willing to try? How about starting with small social interactions? For example, striking up a conversation with a cashier or a neighbor? That sounds manageable. I can try that. That’s a good sign! Embracing that mix of feelings can lead to growth. Let’s set a goal for you to have at least one new interaction this week. Sounds good. I can do that."
