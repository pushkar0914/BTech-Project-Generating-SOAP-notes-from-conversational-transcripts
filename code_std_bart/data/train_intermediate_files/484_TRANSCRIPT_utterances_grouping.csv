History of Present Illness (HPI),probably two months ago and i argued via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor with a friend i've had for a few years it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did a few years ago we had a falling out over his treatment of me the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed
Medical and Psychiatric History,right now i'm getting my master's in social work dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel no i haven't yes in two thousand six yes i do
Psychosocial History,i was born in oakland um <sigh> all the different areas of the city uh the different cultures that are here the traffic the um lack of public transportation and the superficiality i i don't i would love to travel more being able to experience a different way of living um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspective um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months and i was in bahia which is in the north and um let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting i think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten um closer to her as an adult uh we talk pretty regularly with my dad i grew up with him mostly he lives in atlanta and um we don't talk as much but we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that contentious or anything and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family in general i'm not really that close to family one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things um this past weekend i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very um analytical sensitive intelligent intellectual i would <sigh> tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer um idea of what i wanted to do as a career i think the fact that i'm in grad school coming from the background that i that i come from low socio-economic status and just pushing through challenges to get here
Risk Assessment,i felt anxious sad and angry yeah those are the main emotions emotionally drained on some ways and at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time
Mental Health Observations,but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful um i listen to music and just lay on my bed and i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise pretty good i don't get angry a lot so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then i'll notice the physical uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going i'm better able to accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on and <sigh> i wish that i had more energy
Physiological Observations,<sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired not really feeling refreshed
