History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing better. I started using a planner for my tasks. It’s really helped me feel more organized. I can see what I need to do each day. That’s great to hear! Being organized can significantly reduce stress. Have you noticed any changes in your work performance or your feelings about work? Yes, I feel less overwhelmed, and I’m able to focus more on my tasks. I did! I spoke up during a meeting when he made a belittling comment. I told him it wasn’t fair. He seemed surprised but didn’t push back. I felt really proud of myself. It felt empowering. I think I’ll be more confident moving forward. Yes, I’ve been trying to engage more with them. It’s nice to feel more connected. Yes, I think about them often, especially when I’m feeling down. Writing those letters has helped. I have! I’m considering visiting their favorite places when I can. I have, but it’s more manageable now. I think I’m learning to cope better. I’ve been practicing mindfulness and journaling. It helps me process my feelings."
