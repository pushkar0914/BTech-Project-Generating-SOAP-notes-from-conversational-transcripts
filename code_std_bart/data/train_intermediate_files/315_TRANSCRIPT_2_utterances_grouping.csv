History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yes, we started to set clear expectations with our daughter about her schoolwork. It’s been a bit of a challenge, but we’re working on it. She seems to understand better. There are still moments of resistance, but overall, she’s adapting. Honestly, it frustrates me. I want her to understand the importance of school. Yeah, there was a time she got upset about a grade, and instead of getting frustrated, I talked her through it calmly. She calmed down and was able to express her feelings. We ended up having a really good conversation."

Therapeutic Interventions,I think taking a step back and reminding myself that she’s still learning would help. A little bit. I tried to take deep breaths when I felt overwhelmed. It helped me calm down before responding. I was able to approach her more positively. I think talking things out with my girlfriend when I’m feeling frustrated could help too.
Next Steps,"I think I need to keep encouraging her to share her feelings and reassure her that it’s okay to make mistakes. I haven’t really, but I think celebrating her achievements would motivate her more. Maybe we could have a little treat or go out for ice cream when she does well on a test. I think it would be great! It would give her something to look forward to."
