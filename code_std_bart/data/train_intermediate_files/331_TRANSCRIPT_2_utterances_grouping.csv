History of Present Illness (HPI),"I felt a bit more relaxed, but the anxiety crept back as the week went on. I had a few job rejections, and that really brought me down. I tried to distract myself with TV and my dog, but it didn’t help much. Not really. I guess I just wanted to avoid feeling bad. I feel sad and frustrated.  I got an email from a job I really wanted, and they said they chose someone else.  I just stared at it for a while. I didn’t know what to feel. I’ve been thinking about my relationship with my brother.  We don’t talk much, and I feel like there’s a wall between us. I think we just have different lives and values. It’s hard to connect. I’ve thought about it, but I’m not sure what to say."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Exactly! Journaling can be a great way to process your emotions. Would you be willing to try that this week? Yeah, I think I could do that. Wonderful! You could write about your feelings regarding the job rejections and any hopes you have for the future.  That sounds helpful. Starting with a simple message can be a good way to reconnect. You could ask how he’s doing or share something that reminds you of him."
Next Steps,"I think I’ll give it a shot. I’d like to focus on my anxiety again and maybe how to communicate better with my brother. Absolutely, we can do that. I’m looking forward to hearing how your journaling goes and how your communication with your brother unfolds."
