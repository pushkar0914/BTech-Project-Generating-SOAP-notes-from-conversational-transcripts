History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I’ve been okay, just trying to adjust to everything. Yeah, I’ve been exploring a bit more. I went to a salsa dancing event last weekend. It was really good! I met some nice people and felt more connected to the community. Definitely. It’s like I can just forget about everything else when I’m dancing. I still worry about work and the future. Sometimes I just can’t shut my mind off. It’s still challenging. I try to ignore him, but it gets under my skin sometimes. I think about them often, especially when I’m feeling lonely. It’s still hard sometimes."

Therapeutic Interventions,"It can be very beneficial. It involves focusing on your breath and being present in the moment. Would you be open to trying a short exercise together now? It feels calming. I can see how it might help. Excellent! In addition to mindfulness, it might help to write down any worries before bed. This way, you can release them for the night. What do you think? It’s definitely a delicate situation. Perhaps we can explore some assertiveness techniques together to help you feel more empowered in those interactions. Perhaps you could create a small ritual or write them letters expressing your thoughts and feelings. What do you think?"
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that. Would you be willing to set aside a few minutes each night to practice this before bed? Yes, I think I could do that. That sounds like a good idea. I often have a lot on my mind. That sounds meaningful. I’d like to try that. Excellent! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember to practice your mindfulness and journaling this week. "
