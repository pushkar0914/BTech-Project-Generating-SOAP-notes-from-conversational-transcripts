History of Present Illness (HPI),"I felt less anxious than before, which was nice.   I think breaking it down into smaller tasks helped a lot.   I think I feel a little more positive.   Probably finishing parts of the paper and having some good moments with friends.   Yeah, I reached out to a friend for help, and it felt good.   It went really well! She was really supportive.   I’ve been thinking about talking to my family more.   I guess I feel like they wouldn’t understand what I’m going through.   Sometimes I just feel really low, even when things are going well.   I think it’s just the combination of my health issues and feeling overwhelmed.   I try to distract myself with activities, but it doesn’t always work.  "

I want to focus on reaching out to family and making time for painting.  "
