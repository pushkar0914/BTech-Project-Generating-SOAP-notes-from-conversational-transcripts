History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I was really nervous at first, but I ended up talking to a couple of people. It was nice, but I still felt a bit out of place. A little. There was one person I chatted with about a shared interest in movies.  I felt good! Like I did something for myself. I’ve been thinking I need to create a budget or something. It feels overwhelming, though. I still have moments, but I’m trying to focus on the connections I’m building."

I haven’t, but that’s a good idea. I think I’ll call him this week. You’re doing great work! I’m proud of you. Let’s check in next week on your progress."
