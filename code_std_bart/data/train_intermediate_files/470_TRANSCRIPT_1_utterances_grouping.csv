History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been okay, just trying to stay positive and look for work. That's good to hear. Last time, you mentioned feeling a little sad about your current situation. Have those feelings changed at all? A bit, but I still feel like I'm stuck sometimes, you know? I had one interview last week, but I didn’t get the job. It was disheartening. I felt hopeful at first, but then I was just disappointed. I thought I did well. Maybe I could have prepared better or practiced more. I just thought I was ready. Um, I’d say I’m a hard worker, a good mother, and I have experience in child development. Sure! I graduated in child development, and I’ve worked with kids in various settings like schools and daycare centers. I think my greatest strength is my ability to connect with children. I really enjoy working with them. Maybe my lack of experience in a formal job setting? I haven’t worked in a while, so I feel a bit rusty. That makes sense. I can say I’m motivated to gain more experience. I feel like I’m trying my best, but sometimes I doubt myself. I still struggle with my insecurities. I wish I could be more confident."

Current Functional Status,"It feels good, actually. I never thought about how to present myself like this. I try to focus on my accomplishments and remind myself that I have skills to offer. I graduated college, and I’ve been a good parent. I also volunteered at a local community center. It feels good. I sometimes forget about the good things I’ve done."

Therapeutic Interventions,Fantastic! We can work on some common interview questions together. How do you feel about role-playing an interview scenario? That sounds helpful! I could use the practice. One technique we can try is positive affirmations. Would you be willing to create some affirmations together? I want to affirm that I’m a good mother and that I’m doing my best.
Next Steps,"That’s a great insight. Preparing can really boost your confidence. Would you like to set a goal for practicing interview skills before your next opportunity? Yeah, that sounds good. I could use some help with that. That’s a great strategy! Keeping a list of your achievements can help reinforce your self-worth. Would you like to create a list together? Yes, that would be helpful. It’s easy to overlook our achievements when we’re focused on challenges. Would you like to keep this list handy for when you feel down? Yes, I think that would help me a lot. That’s a common struggle. Would you be open to exploring some techniques to boost your confidence? Yes, I’d like that. Excellent! Let’s make it a habit to repeat these affirmations daily. How does that sound? Sounds like a plan! I’ll try to remember to do that."
