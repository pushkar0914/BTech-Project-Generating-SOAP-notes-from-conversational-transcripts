History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie. I've been okay, I guess. Still looking for a place, but I did apply for a few jobs. Well, I submitted a couple of applications. I haven’t heard back yet, which is a bit discouraging. I’ve been trying to keep busy, you know? Watching shows, spending time with my son. It helps a little. Mostly those home improvement shows. They make me feel good, like there's potential for change. Definitely! I think I see my own life in those before-and-after scenarios. I just wish I could see that change in my own situation. I feel a little shy about it, but I know they would help if I asked. Mostly administrative roles or personal assisting. I think those would fit my skills best. I haven’t done much with my resume yet. I feel a bit rusty. Awesome! Now, you mentioned feeling low-level depressed. Have you noticed any changes in your mood since we last talked? I still have those days where I feel a bit down, especially when I think about my situation. Mostly about my feelings regarding the job search and my living situation. No, I think we’ve covered a lot already. I feel a bit more motivated."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Sure, I could try that. Maybe something like, “Hey, I’m looking for a place to live. Do you know of any openings?” I think that would be helpful too. It’s been a while since I’ve interviewed. I’ve been trying to write in my journal more. It helps me process my thoughts. That’s a good focus. It might also help to write about what you’re grateful for or any small victories you encounter."
Next Steps,"I guess I need to keep looking at listings and maybe reach out to some friends for recommendations. That’s completely normal. Would it help to set a small goal to update your resume this week? Yes, I think that would help. Just getting it done would ease my mind. We can definitely do that. Let’s schedule some time for it in our next session. How does that sound? I think I’d like to share my job and housing goals with him. It could help me feel more accountable. I could bring it up during dinner tonight. That’s great to hear! I’ll see you next time, and we can work on that mock interview."
