Psychosocial History,"A little bit. I thought about my family visits and how much they mean to me. They made me feel happy, just remembering the good times. Not yet, but I’m planning one for the holidays. Just spending time together, maybe going out to eat and catching up. I feel relaxed and comfortable. It’s nice to be around them. I’ve been thinking about my friendships a lot, too. I really value them, but sometimes I worry that I’m not a good enough friend. I guess I just feel like I’m not always there for them as much as I should be. Well, I missed a couple of get-togethers lately because I was busy. I think they understand, but I still feel guilty. Yeah, I think that could help. I just don’t want them to think I don’t care."
