History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay, working on the meditation and the letter for my brother.   I wrote it, but I haven’t sent it yet.   It felt good, but I’m nervous about sending it.   I’m worried he won’t respond, and that will hurt.   I think I’d feel sad but also relieved that I reached out.  "

Next Steps,"That’s a healthy perspective. It’s about expressing your care, regardless of the outcome. Would you like to set a goal for when you might send it?   Maybe by the end of this week?   That sounds like a fun idea! It could be a great way to explore new areas. Would you like to set a goal to try kayaking sometime?   Yes, I think I’ll look into it for next month.   Maybe I could invite them for a bike ride.  "
