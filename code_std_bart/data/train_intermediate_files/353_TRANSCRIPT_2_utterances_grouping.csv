History of Present Illness (HPI),"It was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but once I got there, I felt okay.  A little. I felt anxious at first, but it faded as I walked around.

Therapeutic Interventions,"Yes, I reminded myself to breathe and I used the affirmation we created. Maybe I could go during a quieter time, like early in the morning. Okay, I could make a list beforehand to keep me focused. How about creating a “safety plan” for when you’re in crowded places?  You could include your breathing exercises, affirmations, and even a way to step outside if needed."
Next Steps,I could aim for this weekend. I want to try going to the grocery store and see how it goes.
