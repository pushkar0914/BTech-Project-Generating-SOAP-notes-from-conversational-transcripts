Psychosocial History,"Hi! I've been okay, you know, just trying to keep my spirits up despite everything. I’ve had a few small gigs, but nothing major. It’s tough finding paid work right now.

I guess I’ve been feeling a bit isolated since the stroke. I feel a little nervous, but also excited. It’s been a while since I’ve reached out to someone in the industry.

I just have to remind myself it’s okay to have those thoughts. Maybe I could write down my feelings or talk to someone about it. "
Next Steps,"That sounds doable. I can start with an old client I enjoyed working with. I could start by planning some activities for myself—maybe join a class or a group. Yes, I think I will! It might help me meet new people too. Yes, I think that would help me process everything."
