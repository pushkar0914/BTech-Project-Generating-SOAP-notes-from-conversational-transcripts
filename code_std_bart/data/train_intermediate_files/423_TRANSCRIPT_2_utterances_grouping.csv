History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been doing okay. I tried journaling once, but I didn’t keep up with it. I felt a bit awkward at first, but it was nice to get my thoughts out. I think I just got busy and forgot about it. Yes, I’ve been doing it in the mornings. It really helps me start my day off right. I feel more centered and less anxious, especially when I start my day with it. Sometimes I still find my mind wandering, but I try to bring it back. I did it! It felt good to acknowledge those memories. It felt cathartic. I cried a little, but I also felt a sense of closure. I think I’m starting to accept that it’s over. I want to focus on myself more and maybe explore new hobbies. I feel hopeful. It’s nice to have something to look forward to. I’ve been thinking about my job search again. I feel like I’m not making progress. I’ve applied to a couple more jobs, but I haven’t heard back yet."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One technique is to focus on your senses. For example, when you’re outside, take a moment to notice what you see, hear, and feel. It can help ground you in the present moment.  Networking doesn’t have to be intimidating. You could start by sending a friendly message to someone you know, asking how they’ve been and if they have any advice."
