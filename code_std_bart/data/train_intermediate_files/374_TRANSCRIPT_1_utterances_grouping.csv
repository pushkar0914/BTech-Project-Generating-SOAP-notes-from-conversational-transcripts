History of Present Illness (HPI),"I'm glad to hear that. Last time, we talked about your job search and some feelings of guilt around productivity. Have you made any progress on that front? Yeah, I actually sent out a few more resumes this week. It felt good to take that step, even though I still feel a bit overwhelmed. It felt relieving but also a little nerve-wracking. I just keep worrying about whether I’ll hear back or if I’ll even get an interview. I guess I worry that I’m not good enough or that I won’t stand out among the other applicants.  Yeah, I tend to shut down a bit. I’ll start second-guessing myself and then I don’t want to apply to more jobs. I think reminding myself of my strengths could help. I mean, I’ve worked hard and have a lot of experience, but sometimes it just feels overshadowed by self-doubt."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Just the usual stuff—how things are going with me and how she’s doing. She always asks about my job search, and I think she worries. Mostly, yeah. Sometimes I feel like she doesn’t quite understand the industry, but I appreciate her concern. I haven’t, but that could be a good idea. Maybe if I explain the challenges, she wouldn’t worry so much."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s a good realization. Would you be open to creating a list of your strengths and accomplishments to refer back to when those doubts creep in? Yeah, I think that could be really helpful. It can be hard to remember to practice self-care when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Would you be willing to set a reminder on your phone for a few minutes of deep breathing before bedtime? That sounds doable. I could try that."
Next Steps,"As we wrap up today’s session, let’s set some goals for the next week. You mentioned sending out resumes, working on your strengths list, and trying deep breathing. How does that sound? That sounds good! I’ll try to do all of that."
