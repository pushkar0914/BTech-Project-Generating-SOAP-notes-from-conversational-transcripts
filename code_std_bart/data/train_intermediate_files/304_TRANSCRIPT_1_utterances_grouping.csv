History of Present Illness (HPI),"I tried to be more mindful about my sleep, but it’s still a struggle. I’ve been trying to limit my screen time before bed, but it’s hard to stick to. I’ve been thinking about my living situation again. I’m still a bit unhappy with my roommates. It’s just that I feel really isolated sometimes. They’re friendly, but we don’t connect like I thought we would. I haven’t really. I don’t want to make things awkward. I think they’d be understanding, but I’m still nervous. I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about my future, especially with my career. I’m worried I won’t find a job in special education after I graduate."

Physiological Observations,"It’s understandable. Sleep can be tricky, especially with a busy schedule. How many hours are you managing to get on average? I think around six hours, sometimes less. I usually scroll on my phone or watch something on Netflix. It feels nice, actually. "

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s on the lower side. Have you tried any techniques we discussed to help improve your sleep? Those activities can be stimulating, which might affect your ability to fall asleep. Would you be open to trying some relaxation exercises before bed? Yeah, I can give that a try. Great! We can practice some mindfulness exercises here today. Would you like to start with a quick breathing exercise? Sure, that sounds good. That sounds tough. Have you thought about talking to them about how you’re feeling? I understand that concern. It might help to express your feelings in a gentle way. Would you like to role-play how that conversation might go? That could be helpful, yeah. Um, I’d probably say something like, “Hey, I feel a bit lonely sometimes, and I’d love to connect more.” That’s completely normal. Remember, you’re sharing your feelings, which is important. Would it help to write down your thoughts before talking with them? Yeah, I could do that. It’s understandable to feel that way. Have you considered any steps to prepare for your job search? Not really. I guess I should start looking into internships or volunteering. That’s a proactive approach! Gaining experience can really help build your confidence. Would you like to set a goal for the week to explore some opportunities? Yeah, I can look for some internships."
Next Steps,Perfect! Let’s aim for at least two applications or inquiries by our next session. How does that sound? That sounds doable.
