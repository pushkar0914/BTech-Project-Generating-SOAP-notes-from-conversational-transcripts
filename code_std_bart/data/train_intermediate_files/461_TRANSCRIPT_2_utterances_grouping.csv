Therapeutic Interventions,"Perhaps we could add a gratitude practice. Before bed, you could take a moment to write down three things you’re grateful for that day.  Great! Let’s start with a simple mindfulness exercise. I’ll guide you through it. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in through your nose... and out through your mouth. As you breathe, focus on the sensation of the air filling your lungs. Notice how your body feels. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath. Let’s do this for a couple of minutes. Just breathe and be present. That’s wonderful! Mindfulness can be a powerful tool for managing anxiety. Would you like to practice this technique daily? Maybe I can write them down in a journal."
Next Steps,Perfect! Let’s set a goal for you to practice mindfulness for just five minutes each day this week.
