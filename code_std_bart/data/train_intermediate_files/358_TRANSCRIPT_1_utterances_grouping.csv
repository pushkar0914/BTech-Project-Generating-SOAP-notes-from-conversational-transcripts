History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie. I've been okay, I guess. A little up and down, but that's usual for me.   Yeah, I’ve had some moments where I felt a bit lighter, but then there are days where everything feels heavy again.   I think it’s mostly stress. Sometimes it’s work-related, or just life in general.   I’ve been trying to take breaks more often, but it’s hard to disconnect sometimes.   I usually just scroll through my phone or watch some YouTube clips.   I tend to stay up late, especially if I’m playing poker online.  "
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"It’s still pretty strained. I try not to think about it too much, but sometimes it just comes up.   I vent to my sisters sometimes. They get it.   Yeah, I think so. They know what I’ve been through.   I haven’t really thought about it. I guess I just avoid them.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I haven't really tried that. I guess I always thought it wouldn’t work for me.   Sure, I can give it a shot.  "
Next Steps,"Yeah, I think I can do that.   I could try that. I usually go to bed around 2 AM. Maybe I can aim for midnight instead.   I’m willing to give it a shot.   I guess I could think about it.   Yeah, I’ll think about it.  "
