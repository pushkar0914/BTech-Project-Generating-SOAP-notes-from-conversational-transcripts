History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’m excited but also a bit overwhelmed by the idea of going back to school.   Just the thought of balancing everything—work, kids, and school.   Sometimes I still get stressed and need to remind myself to focus.   I applied to a couple but haven’t heard back yet.   I’ve been trying to keep busy, but it’s hard not to think about it.  "

Psychosocial History,"Pretty good! I did some research on social work and looked into some programs.   There are a few local programs that sound interesting. Some even offer online classes.   I could ask my girlfriend to help out on those nights.   Not yet, but I think she’d be on board.   I think she’d be really supportive.   I’ve been trying to spend more quality time with my kids, and it’s been nice.   We started reading together every night, and they love it.   It feels really rewarding. I feel closer to them.   They seem happier and more open with me.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s understandable. Remember to use the mindfulness techniques we practiced. It’s a skill that takes time to develop.   And don’t hesitate to take breaks when you need them. It’s important to recharge.   It’s natural to feel that way. Maybe setting aside specific times to look for jobs could help.   You could also celebrate small victories, like submitting an application, regardless of the outcome.  "
Next Steps,"Let’s set that as a goal for the week—dedicate some time to job searching, and celebrate your efforts!  "
