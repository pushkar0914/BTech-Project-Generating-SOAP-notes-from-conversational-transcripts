History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I started that summer class, and I’m trying to find a job too.   Not great. I’ve applied to a few places, but I haven’t heard back yet.   I try to remind myself that it’s not personal, but sometimes it’s hard to shake off those negative thoughts.   I keep thinking, “I’ll never get hired.”   Well, I haven’t heard back from anyone yet.   I mean, I have applied to several places, and I did get an interview last year.   It feels a bit relieving, actually.   I sometimes think I’m not good enough to be a philosophy major.   I guess I sometimes struggle with certain concepts.   Well, I’ve done well in my classes overall, and I really enjoy the subject.   Much better, actually.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"One technique we could try is cognitive restructuring. It involves identifying negative thoughts and challenging them. Would you like to give it a try?   I could say, “I haven’t heard back yet, but that doesn’t mean I won’t get hired.”   Maybe I could say, “I’m still learning, and I’ve done well so far.”   I’ve done some deep breathing exercises, but I don’t always remember to do them.   One exercise is the “5-4-3-2-1” grounding technique. It involves identifying five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.  "
Next Steps,"I think I’d like to practice reframing at least once a day.   I could set a reminder on my phone.   Yes, I’ll try to do it at least once a day.  "
