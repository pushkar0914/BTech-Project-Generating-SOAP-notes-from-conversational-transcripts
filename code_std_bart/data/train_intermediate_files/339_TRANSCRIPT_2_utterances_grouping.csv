Current Functional Status,"Yes, I applied for a couple of positions, and I actually got an interview for one of them! Um, I would say I’m an English major with a passion for music. I’ve been working on my singing and looking for opportunities to combine that with my career. I can mention my adaptability and how I’m a good communicator. Those are important in any job. I think I’m good for now. I feel more prepared for the interview."
