Substance Use History,"Fantastic! Now, I’d like to revisit the topic of your drinking. How has it been since you quit? It’s been tough at times, especially when I’m feeling down. I miss that escape. I’ve been trying to drink more water and herbal tea, but it’s not the same."
History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's understandable. Last time, we talked about your financial worries and how they affect your mood. Have there been any changes in that area? Not really. I'm still stressed about money. I've been applying to jobs, but nothing has come through yet. I've been trying to meditate a bit, but it's hard to focus when my mind is racing. I took my dog to the park last weekend. It was nice to get out and enjoy the fresh air. That sounds lovely! Spending time with your dog can be very therapeutic. Did you notice any changes in your mood while you were out? I used to like painting and drawing. I haven’t done that in years. I guess I’m just worried about how long this job search will take.  Maybe we could dive deeper into my anxiety and how to manage it."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Meditation can be challenging, especially when you're feeling anxious. Would you like to explore some other coping strategies together? One technique that might help is grounding exercises. They can bring you back to the present moment and help reduce anxiety. Would you like to try one? Great! Let’s try a simple one. Take a moment to notice your surroundings. Can you describe three things you can see right now? Good job! Now, can you focus on two things you can hear? Excellent. And finally, can you identify one thing you can touch? It’s a good start! Finding healthier alternatives can be challenging. We can also explore other activities that might serve as distractions or coping mechanisms. What do you think about that? How about we brainstorm some activities that you enjoy or have wanted to try? "
Next Steps,"That’s great! It sounds like nature and being active can help improve your mood. How often do you think you could incorporate that into your week? Maybe I could try to go to the park a couple of times a week. That sounds like a solid plan. Let’s set that as a goal for next week. How does that sound? That sounds like a wonderful creative outlet! Would you be willing to set aside some time to explore that again? Yeah, I could try that. Maybe I’ll pick up some supplies this weekend. Yeah, I could reach out to some old colleagues. You’re welcome! Let’s make that a goal for the week too. "
