History of Present Illness (HPI),"Definitely. I’ve been more motivated to write since then.   Sometimes I get stuck on ideas or feel overwhelmed by the pressure to create something good.   Just the usual work stress, but I’m managing it.   A few, but I’ve been trying to let them go.  "
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Yeah, I actually had dinner with some friends last week. It was nice to catch up.   It felt great. I really enjoy those deep conversations.   Well, we talked about our writing projects, and I got some really good feedback. It was encouraging.   I try to remind myself that I can’t change the past and focus on the present instead.  "

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve tried free-writing before, which helps, but I don’t always remember to do it.   I’ve done some breathing exercises, but I’m not consistent.  "
Next Steps,"Free-writing can be a great tool! Would you like to set a goal to incorporate that into your routine?   Sure, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe I can do it for ten minutes a day?   I think I can manage that.   Would you be open to setting a goal to practice mindfulness a few times a week?   Yes, I think that would help. Maybe I could do it a couple of times a week.   That sounds like a good plan! How about we aim for two sessions a week to start?   Okay, I can do that.   I’m glad to hear that. I think we’ve covered a lot today. Let’s recap: you’ll work on free-writing for ten minutes a day and practice mindfulness twice a week.  "
