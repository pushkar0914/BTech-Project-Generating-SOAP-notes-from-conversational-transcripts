History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's good to hear. Last time we talked about your uncle and how his passing has affected you. How have you been feeling about that recently? Well, it still hurts, but I’m starting to find some peace with it. I think about him a lot, but I’m trying to focus on the good memories. Yeah, I remember all the times we would watch old movies together. He loved film noir too, and we’d spend hours talking about them. I did! I watched ""Double Indemnity"" last week. It was like he was right there with me. That’s wonderful. Keeping those connections alive can be really healing. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation since our last talk? Not really. I’ve just been going through the motions. I know I should exercise or do something productive, but it feels like too much effort. Well, I’ve been thinking about my weight and how I want to lose some, but it’s hard to get motivated. I feel a bit lighter, actually. It’s nice to talk about things."

Next Steps,"Great! One approach we can consider is setting small, achievable goals for yourself. What’s one small thing you could commit to this week? Maybe I could go for a short walk a couple of times. That seems doable. That sounds like a perfect start! Walking can really help lift your mood and clear your mind. How about we aim for two short walks this week? Yeah, I can do that. Awesome! And if you feel up to it, you could also try journaling about your feelings or your memories of your uncle.  I’ve never really journaled before, but I could give it a shot. It doesn’t have to be anything formal. Just write down whatever comes to mind. It might help you process your emotions. Okay, I’ll try that too. How about starting with a goal to incorporate a healthy snack into your day? Something simple like fruit or nuts. That sounds manageable. I can do that."
