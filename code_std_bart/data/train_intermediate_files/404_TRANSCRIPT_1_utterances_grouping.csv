History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yes, I have. I’ve thought a lot about my arguments with friends and how I can be more proactive in handling those situations. Yes, there was a situation with a friend where we disagreed about plans. Instead of getting defensive, I listened to her point of view. I’ve been thinking about my bird again. I still feel guilty about letting it go. I value companionship and responsibility. I feel like I failed in that."

Psychosocial History,"Hi, Ellie. I've been okay, a bit busy with work and family stuff."
Risk Assessment,"I feel a bit nervous, but I think it’s important. I feel anxious. I worry about how the other person will react."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Well, I tried to pause before reacting when I felt a disagreement coming on. It helped me stay calm. Mindfulness can help you stay present and reduce anxiety. Would you be open to trying a simple breathing exercise together?"
Next Steps,"I want to keep practicing patience and listening. Maybe I could also try to express my feelings more clearly. Sure! Maybe I could set a goal to express my feelings in at least one conversation this week. That’s great to hear. You can use this technique before a conversation to help ground yourself. How do you feel about incorporating this into your goals? I think that could really help. I’ll try to do that before I express my feelings. I could consider getting another pet, but I want to be sure I’m ready. Maybe in a few months? I want to make sure I’m in a good place first. I think I want to focus on being more mindful and patient with myself and others."
