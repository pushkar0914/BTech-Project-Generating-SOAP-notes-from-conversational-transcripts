History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie. It’s been alright, I guess. I tried that pause technique we talked about. Honestly, it was a mixed bag. There were moments when I remembered to pause, and others where I forgot completely. Yeah, there was a moment when I was playing video games with friends, and one of them made a joke about my skills. I felt that anger creeping in, but I took a breath and paused.  They were surprised at first, but then I just laughed it off instead of flipping out. It felt good. I think I was just really aware of how I didn’t want to react like I used to. It was like I had a little voice in my head reminding me. Yeah, there was one time when I got really mad at my roommate over something dumb. I just exploded. It was just a buildup of stuff. I felt like he wasn’t respecting my space, and it just boiled over. No, not yet. I’m kind of avoiding it because I feel embarrassed. Yeah, I think I need to. I don’t want to keep feeling this way. I guess it’s mostly when I feel disrespected or ignored. Like I’m not being taken seriously. Yeah, definitely. It’s not just with my roommate. It’s happened with my wife too. Well, there were times when I thought she wasn’t listening to me, and I’d just blow up. I didn’t mean to, but it just happened."
