History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi, Ellie! Yes, I actually tried it a few times. It was nice to just take a moment for myself. It felt refreshing. I didn’t realize how much I needed it until I did it. I felt more relaxed afterward. That’s great to hear! Mindfulness can really help in managing stress. Did you notice any changes in your mood or interactions with others after practicing? I think I was a bit more patient with my daughter. I didn’t get as frustrated as I usually do when she was being a handful. That’s a wonderful outcome! It sounds like you’re starting to see the benefits of mindfulness in your parenting. How has it affected your feelings of overwhelm? It’s helped a lot. I’m starting to realize that I don’t have to be perfect all the time. I guess just being present for her and doing my best. That feels more achievable. Yes, actually. I had a disagreement with my husband about finances, and it escalated quickly. I tried to stay calm, but I ended up raising my voice. I felt like he wasn’t listening to my concerns. I think it’s just the stress of everything piling up. I worry about money a lot, especially with my daughter’s needs. Not really. I usually just blurt it out when I’m upset. Maybe I should try to express my feelings before it gets to that point."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s a great idea! Expressing your feelings before they escalate can lead to more productive conversations. Would you like to practice some ways to approach that? Let’s think of a few phrases you could use when you feel overwhelmed. For example, “I’m feeling stressed about our finances, and I’d like to talk about it.” How does that sound? That sounds good. I can see how that might help set a calmer tone."
Next Steps,"That’s a great mindset to have. Remember, progress takes time, and you’re doing well. Let’s check in on your mindfulness practice next session and see how your communication goes with your husband."
