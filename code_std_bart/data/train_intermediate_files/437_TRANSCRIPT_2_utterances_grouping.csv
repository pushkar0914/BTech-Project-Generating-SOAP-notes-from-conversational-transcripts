Next Steps,I want to keep practicing and maybe even join a local club or group.   I was thinking about a book club since I love reading.   I found a couple online that meet monthly. I’m thinking of attending the next one.   I’ll read the book beforehand and maybe write down some thoughts to share.   I’d like to learn more about mindfulness techniques to help me stay present.   It felt calming. I think I can incorporate this into my daily routine.
