History of Present Illness (HPI),"I think it’s decreased a bit. I still have moments of worry about the wedding, but I’m learning to manage it better. Mostly about my experiences in the PhD program and my feelings about the wedding. It helps me sort through my thoughts. I guess I’m still worried about family dynamics at the wedding. I want everyone to get along, but I know that’s not always realistic. I think they’d be understanding, but I also worry they might bring up past issues."

Psychosocial History,"Hi, Ellie! Things have been pretty busy with the wedding and starting my PhD program."
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,"It felt good! I was nervous at first, but everyone was really friendly. I think I’m starting to find my place there. I feel a bit more confident. Engaging with others makes me realize that I’m not alone in this journey. I feel lighter, like I’ve let some things go. It’s nice to have an outlet. It feels empowering! I think I can handle it better now."

Progress Evaluation,"I’m trying to take it one step at a time. I’ve been sticking to the goals we set, which has helped. Yeah! I reached out to a couple of professors, and they were really welcoming. I also attended a seminar last week. It was really interesting! I learned a lot and even met some other students who are in the program. No, I think that’s it for today. I feel more prepared."
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been practicing the breathing exercises we did last time, and I also try to remind myself that it’s okay to not have everything perfect. I’ve started journaling about my feelings. It helps me process everything."
Next Steps,"I’ve considered talking to my family beforehand, setting some boundaries, and maybe even having a plan for if things get tense. I’d probably say something like, “I really want this day to be special for everyone, and I hope we can all support each other.” I could remind them that the focus is on the celebration and that I want everyone to enjoy the day."
