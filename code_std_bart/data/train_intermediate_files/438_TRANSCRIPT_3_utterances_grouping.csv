History of Present Illness (HPI),"It’s been really rewarding. I’m working with kids, and it feels great to give back. I’ve realized how much I enjoy being around kids. It makes me think more seriously about counseling. It excites me! I feel like I’m on the right track. I feel motivated. I want to make a positive impact on others, just like I’m doing now. I’m drawn to working with children and families, especially those facing challenges similar to mine. I think it will help me connect with clients on a deeper level. I want them to feel understood. It makes me feel connected to them, but it also worries me knowing they’re stressed."
