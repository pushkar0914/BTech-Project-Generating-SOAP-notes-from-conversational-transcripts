History of Present Illness (HPI),"I managed to get to bed by midnight a few nights, but I still slipped back into my old habits a couple of times.   I got caught up in playing poker online again.   I’ve had some good days, but I still feel moody at times.   Stress, mostly. And sometimes just feeling lonely.   I thought about it a bit. I think I need to distance myself more to protect my mental health.   A little nervous, but I think it’s necessary.  "

Next Steps,"Yeah, I can try setting a timer.   That’s understandable. Even small interactions can make a difference. Would you consider joining a local poker club or a group related to your hobbies?   It might be a good way to meet new people who share your interests. Plus, it could help combat feelings of loneliness.   Yeah, I think I’ll look into that.   I think I’ll limit contact and not engage in conversations that lead to conflict.   I’d say something like, “I’m not in a good place to talk right now.”   Maybe I could say, “Let’s talk later when I’m feeling better.”  "
