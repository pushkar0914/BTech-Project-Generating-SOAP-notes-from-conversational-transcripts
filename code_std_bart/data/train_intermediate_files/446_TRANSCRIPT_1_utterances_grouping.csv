History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time, you mentioned feeling great overall but faced some frustration from the argument with your husband. How has that been since then? It’s been better. We talked it out a bit more, and I think we both understand each other a little better now. He was receptive, actually. It helped that I was calm when I brought it up. We both agreed to work on our communication style. Well, I’ve been a bit stressed about going back to school. I’m excited but also nervous about balancing everything. I guess I worry about managing my time between work, family, and studying. I don’t want to let anyone down."

Therapeutic Interventions,I really just tried to express my feelings without being defensive. I focused on “I” statements to explain how I felt when he reacted aggressively.
Next Steps,"I’ve been considering creating a schedule to balance everything out. I think it might help me feel more organized. Definitely work, school, and family time. I also want to make sure I have time for myself. I think I can manage about 40 hours for work, 15 hours for school, and a couple of evenings for family. I want to set aside at least one day for myself too. I think that’s important. I’ve realized that when I take care of myself, I’m better for everyone else. I love meditating, reading, and sometimes just taking a long walk. Yes, I’d like to aim for at least three times a week for meditation and reading. I could do that on weekends, maybe Saturday mornings. I think that’s a good point. I’ll try to be flexible and adjust as needed."
