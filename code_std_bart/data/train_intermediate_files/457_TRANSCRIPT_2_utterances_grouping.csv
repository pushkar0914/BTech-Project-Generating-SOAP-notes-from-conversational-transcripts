History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey, Ellie! It went pretty well. I tried the breathing exercise a few times, and it really helped me calm down. It was refreshing. I felt more centered during conversations, especially with my friends while working on the mural. Yeah, I was definitely more present. I listened more and didn’t interrupt as much. I did! I told her how much I appreciate her and how she inspires me. It felt good to open up. She was really sweet about it. She said she feels the same way, which made me really happy. I feel excited! It’s nice to have someone who understands me. I called my mom last week. We had a decent conversation, and I tried to be more patient with her. It felt good. I didn’t get as frustrated as I usually do, so that was a win. I think I get overwhelmed by the scope of the project, and then I avoid it. I haven’t really done that. I usually just dive in and then get lost. I think it’s when I compare myself to others or when I feel like my work isn’t as good as theirs. I’ve tried, but it’s hard to shake off that feeling of inadequacy."

Therapeutic Interventions,Breaking tasks down can help make them feel less daunting. Would you like to try that for your mural project? It’s understandable. Perhaps you could keep a journal of your accomplishments and positive feedback from others to remind yourself of your growth.
Next Steps,I want to keep working on my motivation and try to journal my achievements.
