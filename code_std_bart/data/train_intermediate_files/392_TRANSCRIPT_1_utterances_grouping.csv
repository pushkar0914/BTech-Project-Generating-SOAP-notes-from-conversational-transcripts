Trauma History,"Sure, I think it might be related to my sister’s death. I keep thinking about it more lately. Yeah, I remember when we used to go to the beach together. We’d just sit and talk for hours."

History of Present Illness (HPI),"Fantastic! Relaxation techniques can be really effective. Have you noticed any situations where you felt more stressed than usual? Yeah, work has been a bit hectic lately. I feel like I'm constantly under pressure. I see. What do you think is contributing to that pressure? I think it’s just the workload and deadlines piling up. I feel like I’m always racing against time. That sounds overwhelming. How do you usually cope with that feeling? I try to distract myself with TV or hanging out with friends, but sometimes it feels like it's just postponing the problem. It’s understandable to want to escape the pressure. Have you thought about setting boundaries at work to manage your workload better? I haven’t really considered that. I don’t want to seem like I can’t handle it. That’s the goal! Taking action can often reduce anxiety. Speaking of anxiety, have you noticed any changes in how you feel since our last session? I think I’ve been a bit more anxious, especially about work and some personal stuff. It makes me smile, but it also makes me feel sad that I can’t do that anymore."

Therapeutic Interventions,"That’s good to hear. Have you had a chance to practice any of the deep breathing techniques we talked about? That’s a great start! How did that work for you? It’s natural to have those concerns. What if we brainstorm some ways to communicate your needs effectively at work? Great! How about starting with a simple email to your supervisor about your current workload? You could express your willingness to meet deadlines but also mention feeling overwhelmed. Excellent! Would you like to try writing that email together now? Okay, let’s start with a greeting. How about, “Hi [Supervisor’s Name], I hope this message finds you well”? Next, you could say something like, “I wanted to discuss my current workload and some challenges I’ve been facing.”  Maybe something like, “I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with the deadlines and would appreciate your guidance on prioritizing tasks.” Maybe I could ask for a meeting to discuss it further? Absolutely! You could conclude with, “Could we schedule a time to discuss this further?” I’d like that. Maybe I could write about her? Writing can be a powerful way to process your feelings. Would you want to start a journal dedicated to her? That sounds nice. I could write down memories or lessons she taught me."
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that. Let’s set a goal for you to write one memory each week. How does that sound? That sounds manageable. I can do that. Perfect! I look forward to hearing how that goes in our next session. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps."
