History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s completely understandable. Last time, we talked about your feelings of lethargy and your experiences with depression. Have you noticed any changes in those feelings since then? Not really. I still feel pretty much the same. Some days are better than others, but overall, it’s still tough. I appreciate your honesty. It’s important to recognize that progress can be slow and nonlinear. Have there been any specific situations that have triggered those feelings recently? Well, I had a family gathering last week. It was nice to see everyone, but I felt really drained afterward.  Family gatherings can be emotionally taxing. What do you think contributed to that feeling of being drained? I think it’s just being around so many people and trying to put on a happy face. It takes a lot out of me. That makes sense. It sounds like you might be feeling some pressure to maintain a certain image. Would you say that’s accurate? Yeah, definitely. I want to be there for my kids and show them I’m okay, but it can be exhausting. It’s commendable that you want to be strong for your children. Have you thought about ways to manage that pressure during family events? Wonderful! I’d love to hear about your experiences with it in our next session. Now, let’s talk a bit more about your feelings of worry regarding your children. You mentioned that you often feel anxious about them. Can you share more about those worries? I worry about their futures, especially with everything going on in the world. It’s hard not to think about it. That’s a valid concern. The world can feel overwhelming at times. Have you talked to your children about your worries? Not really. I don’t want to burden them with my feelings."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One strategy could be to set small boundaries for yourself. For example, allowing yourself to take breaks during the gathering or giving yourself permission to leave early if you feel overwhelmed. Would that be something you’d consider? Yeah, I think that could help. I’ll need to practice that, though. Absolutely, it’s all about practice. Speaking of practice, have you been able to implement any coping strategies we discussed in our last session, like mindfulness or relaxation techniques? I’ve tried a few breathing exercises when I feel anxious, but it’s hard to remember to do them. It can definitely be challenging to remember to practice new skills. Would you be open to setting a specific time each day to practice those techniques, even if it's just for a few minutes? That sounds doable. Maybe in the morning before I start my day? That sounds like a great plan! Starting your day with a few minutes of mindfulness could set a positive tone. How do you feel about journaling your experiences with these techniques? Journaling could be helpful. I’ve never really done it, but I’ve heard it can be beneficial. It can be a powerful tool for self-reflection. You could jot down how you feel before and after practicing mindfulness. Would you be willing to give it a try? Sure, I can give that a shot."
Next Steps,I think I need to work on setting boundaries during family gatherings and practice mindfulness more consistently. Journaling could also help me reflect on my feelings. Those sound like excellent goals! I believe you’re making progress. Let’s check in on how those strategies worked for you in our next session.
