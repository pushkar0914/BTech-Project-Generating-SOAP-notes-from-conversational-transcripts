History of Present Illness (HPI),"It was great! I felt really happy, just like I mentioned last time. Definitely. It’s like my escape from everything else. I feel free, you know? Like I can express myself without any limits. Sometimes I get stuck or frustrated if I can't get it right. I think I’ve been feeling more focused, especially with school and music. I guess just being more organized and setting small goals for myself. I want to finish a few songs this semester and also get better at mixing."

Psychosocial History,"It’s good! We’re just busy with our own things, but we make time for each other. Yeah, we usually talk things out. It helps a lot. Not really, just the usual disagreements about what to watch or eat."

Physiological Observations,"A little more relaxed, actually."
Current Functional Status,"I usually take a break, go ride my bike, and then come back to it later. Yeah, for sure. I come back with fresh ideas. I try to keep busy, like hanging out with friends or watching movies. I’m trying to dedicate specific days to work on my music and practice mixing techniques. I just try to stay calm and not let it escalate."
