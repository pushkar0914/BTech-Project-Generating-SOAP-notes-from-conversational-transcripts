History of Present Illness (HPI),"It sounds like a joyful experience. You mentioned feeling a bit worried about your children’s safety in today’s world. Have you found ways to cope with those worries since we last spoke? I’ve been trying to focus more on the positive aspects of their lives and the choices they’re making. It helps me feel less anxious. Perfect! Let’s see how that goes. You also mentioned feeling guilty about not being more aware when you were younger. Have you had any reflections on that since our last session? I have. I realize now that I can’t change the past, but I can be more present for my children and granddaughter now."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"Yes! We had a family barbecue over the weekend. It was nice to catch up with everyone and just enjoy each other's company. Just seeing everyone laughing and enjoying the food. My granddaughter was running around playing with her cousins, and it brought back such good memories from my childhood. We love going for walks and having movie nights. Those are always fun."

Current Functional Status,"It’s been good. I feel more centered when I remember to do it. But sometimes I struggle to keep it consistent. I’ve started sketching more regularly. It feels good to get back into it, but I still find myself easily distracted. I think it’s mostly my phone and social media. I find myself scrolling instead of creating. I feel more confident. I try to communicate openly with my children, and I think it’s helping our relationships. I usually just go with the flow, but I think I need to be more intentional about scheduling time for both."

Therapeutic Interventions,I’ve been practicing mindfulness a bit more. Just taking a few moments to breathe and remind myself that they are capable adults.
Next Steps,"Consistency can be a challenge. Would you like to set a goal for how often you practice mindfulness this week? Sure, I think I could aim for at least three times a week. That’s a common challenge. Would you be open to setting some boundaries around your phone use during your creative time? Yes, I think that could help. Maybe I can put my phone in another room while I work. That’s a solid plan. How about we aim for a specific time frame each day where you dedicate yourself to art without distractions? I could try for an hour each evening after dinner. That sounds doable. Scheduling can be very effective. Would you like to create a weekly plan together that includes time for your art and family? Yes, I’d love that! I think having a visual plan could help me stick to it. Great! Let’s outline a basic structure for your week. How many hours do you think you’d like to dedicate to your art? I’d like to aim for at least five hours throughout the week. That’s a good start. We can break that down into smaller chunks. How about one hour on weekdays and two hours on the weekend? That sounds perfect. I can manage that. Those sound like great bonding activities. How about scheduling a family walk on the weekends and a movie night during the week? Yes! I think that would work well."
