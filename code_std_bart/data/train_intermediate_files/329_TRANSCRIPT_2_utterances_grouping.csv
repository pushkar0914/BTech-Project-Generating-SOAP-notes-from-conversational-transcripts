History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi! I’ve been okay, a bit busy, but I did ask for help from my colleague like we talked about.   It went really well! They were more than happy to help, and it took a lot of pressure off me.   It felt liberating, honestly. I realized I don’t have to do everything alone.   That’s a powerful realization. It sounds like you’re building your confidence in asking for help. Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels since then?   Definitely! I feel less overwhelmed and more capable of managing my workload.   I think I could use some support with setting boundaries. I sometimes say yes to too many things.   Usually when friends ask me to hang out or when clients want extra sessions.   I feel drained and sometimes resentful, which isn’t fair to anyone.   Yes! A friend asked me to join an event I wasn’t really interested in, but I felt guilty saying no.   I’ve also been thinking about my meditation practice. I want to deepen it.   Maybe trying different techniques or styles. I’ve mostly stuck to the same routine.  "
