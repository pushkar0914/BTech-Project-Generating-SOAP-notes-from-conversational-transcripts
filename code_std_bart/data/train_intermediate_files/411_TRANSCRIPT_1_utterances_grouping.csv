History of Present Illness (HPI),"I've been doing pretty well, actually. Just trying to keep up with everything. Not really. I’ve been trying to focus more on the positive aspects of interactions. I think it’s helping. Yeah, I think I’m feeling lighter. I try to let go of things that don’t serve me or that I can’t control. Sometimes I feel like I don’t have enough time, or I forget to make it a priority. It’s been a bit challenging, but I’ve been more mindful about protecting my skin when I’m outdoors. I’ve been more aware of how I react to situations. I think I’m getting better at taking a step back before responding. Yes, I think I’m more open with my friends about how I feel instead of bottling things up."

Psychosocial History,"Not really traveling, but I did meet up with some friends I hadn’t seen in a while. We went to this amazing Moroccan restaurant. It felt really good. We laughed a lot and reminisced about old times. It reminded me of how important those connections are. I think it’s a mix. I try to initiate plans, but sometimes life gets busy. I’m glad they reached out this time. I had a deep talk with my sister about our childhood. It felt good to share our experiences and validate each other. I feel closer to her now. It was nice to hear her perspective and realize we went through similar struggles."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I try to meditate when I can. It helps clear my mind and ground me. I really like guided meditations. They help me focus and keep my mind from wandering. I’ve used Headspace and Insight Timer. They both have some great options. I try to exercise regularly, and I’ve been practicing yoga, which helps a lot."
Next Steps,"I’ve been doing it a few times a week, but I’d like to make it a daily habit. Yes, I think that would help me stick to it. Maybe in the morning before starting my day. Those are both excellent choices! Perhaps you could explore a few new meditations that focus on letting go or gratitude to support your new mindset. That’s a good idea. I’ll look into that. I’ve been going to a class once a week, but I’d like to do some home practice too. I think I could do that. Maybe a short session a few times a week. I’d like to delve deeper into how I can manage stress better and maybe explore more mindfulness techniques."
