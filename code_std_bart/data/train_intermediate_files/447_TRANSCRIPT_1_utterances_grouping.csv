History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time, you mentioned feeling stressed about those court tickets. Have you made any progress on that front? Yeah, I actually spoke to a friend who's a lawyer. They said I might be able to get a payment plan or something, so that felt good. Honestly, it felt kind of weird at first. I’m not used to asking for help, you know? But it was nice to have someone who knows what they’re talking about. Absolutely. You also mentioned in our last session about bottling up your emotions. Have you noticed any changes in how you handle your feelings since we last spoke? I’ve been trying to talk to my friends more. Like, if something's bothering me, I’ll just bring it up instead of keeping it in. It was about feeling lost and trying to find my way. I think it reflects how I’ve been feeling lately. Fantastic! Let’s also revisit your feelings of stress. You mentioned before that you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your obligations. How are you managing that now? I’ve tried working out more when I’m angry, but sometimes it doesn’t feel like enough."

Current Functional Status,"It’s been good, actually. They’re supportive, and it feels nice to not carry everything alone. It’s been good! I wrote a new song last week. It felt nice to express myself through it. Definitely. When I write, I feel like I can let everything out without judgment. I’ve been trying to prioritize my tasks and take things one step at a time. It’s not perfect, but it helps. I started using a planner to keep track of deadlines and stuff. It feels nice to check things off. It feels satisfying! Like I’ve accomplished something, even if it’s small."

Next Steps,I could! I’ve been thinking about setting aside time each week just to write and not worry about anything else. I haven’t really thought about journaling. I guess I could try that. I’d like to have at least a couple of journal entries written by then and maybe write another song.
