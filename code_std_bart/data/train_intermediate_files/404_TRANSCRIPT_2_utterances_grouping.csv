History of Present Illness (HPI),"Yes, I did! I talked to my friend about how I felt when we argued about plans. I often end up giving in to their needs, even when I need time alone. Not really. I worry they might take it personally. I feel nervous, but I also think it’s necessary. A bit anxious, but I think it’s time."

Progress Evaluation,"Hi, Ellie! I’ve been doing well. I tried the breathing exercises we talked about. It went really well. She listened, and we ended up having a really good conversation. I learned that it’s okay to be vulnerable. It actually brought us closer. I feel more confident now. I think I can express myself more often. I’ve been trying to remind myself that I did what I thought was best at the time."
Medications,Nothing reported
Therapeutic Interventions,That sounds nice. Maybe I could plant a flower or something in its memory. I think I could try that. I want them to understand that it’s not about them.
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that. Would you like to set a goal around creating that memory space? Yes, I’ll aim to do that by next month. I could talk to my mom this weekend about needing some time for myself. I want to focus on being honest about my needs, both with myself and my family."
