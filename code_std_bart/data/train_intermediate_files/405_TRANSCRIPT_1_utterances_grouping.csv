History of Present Illness (HPI),"Well, I've been thinking a lot about the divorce and how I need to start looking for a job. It’s just a lot to handle. That sounds like a significant amount of stress. Have you made any progress on the job search? Not really. I keep telling myself I need to start, but I just feel stuck.  It's understandable to feel stuck. Sometimes taking the first step can be the hardest. What do you think is holding you back? I guess I’m afraid of failing. I haven't worked in years, and I don’t even know where to start. Fear of failure is a common feeling, especially during transitions. What if we explored some potential job options together?  That might help. I just feel like I don’t have any skills anymore. What skills do you think you possess? Sometimes we underestimate our abilities. Well, I’ve organized events for my daughters’ schools, and I was a stay-at-home mom for a long time.  Those are valuable skills! Event planning requires organization and communication, which are highly sought after in many jobs.  It’s easy to overlook our own strengths. How do you feel about possibly looking for part-time work in event planning? That could be interesting. I just worry that I won’t find anything. Now, let’s talk about your feelings regarding the divorce. How are you coping with that? It’s been tough. I feel guilty for wanting to leave, even though I know it’s the right decision. It’s common to feel guilt during a divorce, especially when children are involved. Have you been able to talk to your daughters about it? Not really. I don’t want to upset them more than they already are. It’s understandable to want to protect them. However, sometimes being honest about your feelings can help them process their own emotions.  I know, but I just don’t know how to approach the conversation. We can work on that together. What do you think would be important to convey to them? I want them to know that I love them and that this is not their fault. That could help. I’m nervous, though. I guess I’d say something like, ""I want to talk to you both about some changes happening in our family."" That sounds like a gentle approach. How do you think they might respond? I think they’ll be upset. They’ve seen us argue a bit, but I don’t think they fully understand."

Therapeutic Interventions,That’s a great start. Perhaps we can role-play the conversation to help you feel more prepared? It’s okay to feel nervous. Let’s take it step by step. Imagine how you would want to start the conversation. It might be helpful to reassure them that it’s okay to feel upset and that you’re there to support them.
Next Steps,What if we set a small goal for this week? Maybe you could look up a few local event planning companies or even volunteer for an event to get your feet wet. That sounds doable. I could handle that. Great! How do you feel about setting a specific time to do that? Maybe I could set aside an hour on Saturday to research. That sounds like a solid plan. How about we check in on that next session? Of course! Let’s wrap up for today. I look forward to hearing how your research goes and how the conversation with your daughters unfolds.
