History of Present Illness (HPI),mm it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the um the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and it was different the social culture was different in a way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality <clears throat> mm memorable experiences i guess it would be moving here i moved to when i moved to l_a i got on a plane but didn't know anybody here and we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was it was big monumental i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever very hard because you need to no one's gonna push you to do it you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard 'cause i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say i'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for sort of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you can't ignore those signs just i've been feeling pretty good lately trying to be more focused <clears throat> get things done um just trying to focus on what i wanna do career-wise and really stop wasting time or you know just procrastinating and and get things done and being inspired going and seeing you know being around people that are doing what i wanna do and just carrying it over to my own life my drive being more driven and just getting things done a recent ex-boyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel like i'm let allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so i'm dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts don't second-guess yourself
Medical and Psychiatric History,studied communications um got a lots of every lot of different uh writing writing styles i eventually graduated with a a concentration in public relations and a english minor writing to pursue writing writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first no no
Psychosocial History,uh boston massachusetts i moved to l_a about a year after graduating college in two thousand and one uh quite often at least a couple times a year um god i love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that that i love uh to pursue acting and writing <sigh> oh god <go> i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know <kn> creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year round and uh i like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is what i don't like uh well i miss my family <fam> i miss that there's not <no> i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel eh sort of isolated alone here mm i can't see your shoes but um i do mostly just not not too much worldly travel mostly back to boston and mm eh florida where my parents live but i do i enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within california and around here oh just to have an adventure do something fun or if i'm going home it means i'm gonna see my family i like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco i have family and friends there when i was in boston i we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to l_a and las vegas and that was kind of how i realized i wanted to move here so that was very that was very that was a big one i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i'm completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and has he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and i could not ask for a better family they're my parents for sure they're just wonderful people that just taught by example and i feel like i'm a good mix of both of them uh oh just a couple days i was just in with my family and my baby niece in florida and that's why i went down there to see her so it was just awesome i'm always happy when i see her probably coming out to l_a on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what i wanna do
Risk Assessment,have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it i guess it would've been with uh an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it i don't know if i could've avoided the complete situation but i definitely could've made the outcome much less chaotic in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that
Mental Health Observations,Nothing reported
Physiological Observations,it's pretty easy i try um lately it's been a little bit hard my sleep's been off but for the most part i've come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy <sigh> uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like i'm in a good mood 'cause i might be a little giddy and uh laughing more just sort of <laughter> high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and just um sweat more just feel feel um just a little off
Current Functional Status,i <sigh> sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise calming calming area and just just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to to come back to a calm neutral place i um i did some acting work on a on a series with a really great group of people and it was it was a very cool cool creative experience very inspiring
