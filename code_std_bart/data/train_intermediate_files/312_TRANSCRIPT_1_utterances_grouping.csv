History of Present Illness (HPI),"Not really. I’ve been gathering my materials, but I still feel nervous about the whole process. I guess it’s the fear of not being good enough or not getting in. I’ve been out of school for a while, and I worry I won’t measure up. Yeah, definitely. I remember feeling that way before exams or when I had to present research. I tried to prepare as much as I could. I would study a lot, and I found that helped me feel a bit more confident. I think that could be helpful. I just worry about what they might say."

Physiological Observations,"It’s been a bit better since I’ve been more active, but I still have nights where I struggle. I think it’s mostly when I’m stressed or have a lot on my mind. On those nights, I can’t seem to shut my brain off. It feels calming, actually. I can feel my shoulders relaxing."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Great! One strategy could be setting small, manageable goals for your application process. For example, you could focus on one component at a time, like your personal statement. How does that sound? That sounds doable. I think breaking it down might help me not feel so overwhelmed. Exactly! Also, how do you feel about seeking feedback from colleagues or mentors on your application materials? It’s natural to feel apprehensive about receiving feedback, but it can provide valuable insights. Remember, constructive criticism is a part of growth. Would you like to practice how to ask for feedback? Okay! Let’s role-play. You can start by asking a colleague for feedback on your personal statement. Alright. “Hey, could you take a look at my personal statement and let me know what you think?” That’s a great start! You might also want to add something like, “I’m looking for honest feedback, especially on areas I can improve.” How does that feel? That’s a common experience. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed to help calm your mind? It might be beneficial to explore mindfulness or meditation as well. Would you be open to trying a short mindfulness exercise together now? Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on your breath. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable. Inhale deeply through your nose... and exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together. As you breathe, try to let go of any tension in your body. With each exhale, imagine releasing stress and anxiety. How does that feel for you? That’s wonderful! Practicing this for a few minutes each night could help you wind down before sleep. Would you like to commit to trying this technique?"
Next Steps,I feel more optimistic about them. It seems like I have a plan now.
