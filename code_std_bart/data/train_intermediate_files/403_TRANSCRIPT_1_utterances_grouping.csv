History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! I've been doing pretty well, actually. I've been focusing more on my event planning and trying to get my website off the ground. Yes, I reached out to a few potential clients and got some leads. It feels good to be proactive. I think I often write about my fears of not being good enough or not succeeding, especially in my career. It sometimes makes me hesitate to put myself out there or take risks. I don’t want to fail. I think I’d probably learn a lot, regardless of the outcome. But it’s scary to think about."

Mental Health Observations,"Honestly, it felt empowering. I was a bit nervous at first, but once I started, I felt more confident. A couple of them didn’t respond, which was a bit disheartening. I had to remind myself it’s not personal. I guess I’d feel embarrassed and disappointed. I’d worry about what others think. It feels a bit lighter. I can see that it’s not the end of the world."
Physiological Observations,Definitely! I feel more energized and excited about the possibilities. It’s like I’m finally moving forward.

Therapeutic Interventions,"I just reminded myself that everyone starts somewhere and that I have skills to offer. Plus, I practiced what I wanted to say beforehand. I tried to not dwell on it too much. I went to the gym to clear my head and focus on something positive. I like listening to music and writing in my journal. It helps me process my thoughts. It’s been really helpful. I can write down my frustrations or ideas without judgment, which is freeing. Great! One technique is to visualize the worst-case scenario and then consider how you would cope with that situation. Would you like to try that together? I could remind myself that it’s part of the process. I could reach out to my friend Mojo for support."
Next Steps,I want to reach out to at least three potential clients and not let fear hold me back.
