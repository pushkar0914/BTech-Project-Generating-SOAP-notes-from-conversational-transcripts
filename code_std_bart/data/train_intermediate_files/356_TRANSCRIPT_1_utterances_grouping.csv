History of Present Illness (HPI),"I understand. You mentioned feeling like you were slipping back a little. Can you tell me more about that? I’ve tried setting alarms and making to-do lists, but it’s hard to stick to them when I don’t have much to do. I think when I don’t have a lot of obligations, I just lose motivation. It’s like I’m waiting for something to happen. Yeah, I’ve noticed I’m still dwelling on darker themes, like historical battles and stuff. It’s weird. Sometimes it’s overwhelming. I think I’m just trying to make sense of things. I think it’s the struggle and survival aspect. Maybe it’s a reflection of how I feel sometimes."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One strategy could be to redirect those thoughts when they arise. For instance, when you catch yourself thinking about those themes, you might try to shift your focus to something positive or grounding. I’ll try that. Maybe I can think about my photography instead. That’s a great idea! You can also use mindfulness techniques to bring yourself back to the present moment. Would you be open to practicing a brief mindfulness exercise together now? Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose… and exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together. As you breathe, notice how your body feels. Allow any tension to melt away with each exhale. That’s wonderful! Mindfulness can be a powerful tool to help you manage those overwhelming thoughts. Would you like to incorporate this practice into your weekly routine?"
Next Steps,"I’d need to clear some space in my apartment and maybe invest in some backdrops and lighting. I think that could work. If I schedule it, I might actually follow through. Maybe Saturdays? I usually have more free time then. Yes, I think that could be beneficial. Maybe I can do it before I start my photography sessions. That sounds like a perfect plan! Let’s aim for a few minutes of mindfulness before you begin each Saturday. "
