Mental Health Observations,"Honestly, I felt more relaxed afterward. It’s nice to clear my head a bit.  It was a little awkward at first, but I started writing about my memories with him, and it felt nice to get it out. I think so. I feel like I’m not bottling things up as much. I feel a little more centered and less anxious."
Physiological Observations,Nothing reported
Current Functional Status,"Hey, Ellie. I’ve been trying to stick to the walks we talked about. I managed to go for a walk three times last week. It felt good to get outside. Yeah, it feels good. I also tried journaling a bit. I see my couch, a picture frame, the TV, a window, and my coffee table. I can touch my chair, my phone, my shirt, and the blanket on my lap. I can hear the clock ticking, some birds outside, and the hum of the fridge. I smell coffee and a hint of my laundry detergent. I can taste the coffee in my mouth."

Therapeutic Interventions,"One technique is the “5-4-3-2-1” exercise. It involves naming five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. "
Next Steps,I’d like to keep walking and maybe try a new healthy recipe for dinner. That sounds like a great plan! How about we aim for two walks and one new recipe this week? I can do that!
