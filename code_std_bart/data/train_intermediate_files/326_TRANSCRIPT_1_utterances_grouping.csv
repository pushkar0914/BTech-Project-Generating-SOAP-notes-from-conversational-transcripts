History of Present Illness (HPI),"That’s good to hear. Last time, you mentioned playing guitar and hanging out with friends. Have you had any opportunities to do that recently?   Yeah, I actually played with some friends last weekend. It was fun!   Really good, like a stress relief.   I can imagine. Music can be such a powerful outlet. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels after playing?   It just takes my mind off things. I can focus on the chords and forget about everything else.   How about your relationship with your girlfriend? You mentioned she sometimes frustrates you. Have you had any conversations with her about that?   Not really. I don’t want to start an argument.   Excellent! What’s one specific situation where you felt frustrated with her recently?   Well, she was talking over me during dinner the other night.   I felt ignored, like my opinions didn’t matter.   I think she’d get defensive.   Wonderful! Now, you mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times. What else contributes to that feeling?   Just work, I guess. It can be stressful.   Just deadlines and expectations. I feel like I’m always racing against the clock.   Not really. I just push through.  "

Next Steps,"Maybe we can set a goal for you to play a little each day. How does that sound?   I think I could do that.   Awesome! So, let’s aim for at least 15 minutes a day. We can check in on that next session.   Okay, I can manage that.   That might work. I could ask her why she does that.   Yes! Framing it as a question could open up a dialogue. Would you feel comfortable trying that?   Yeah, I think I could do that.   Great! Let’s also set a goal for you to have that conversation this week.   Okay, I’ll try.   It might be helpful to explore some time management techniques or relaxation exercises. Would you be interested in that?   Yeah, I’d be open to it.   Perfect! We can work on some techniques together. For now, how about we focus on one small thing you can do to relieve stress?   Maybe taking breaks?   Absolutely! Let’s set a goal for you to take at least one break during your workday.   Sounds doable.  "
