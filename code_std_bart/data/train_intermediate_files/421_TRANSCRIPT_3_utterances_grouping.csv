History of Present Illness (HPI),"I set a reminder, but I still ended up watching TV late a few nights.  I’ve felt more centered, but I still struggle to focus sometimes. It was relieving. I didn’t realize how much I was holding in until I started writing. I felt really good. It was nice to reconnect and talk about things. I still feel angry, but I’m trying to focus on my own healing instead of his actions."
