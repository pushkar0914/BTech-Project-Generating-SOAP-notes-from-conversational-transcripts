I feel less pressure when I just let my thoughts flow.   Yes, I’ve been exploring some personal experiences that I hadn’t thought about in a while.   It was a bit emotional, but also cathartic. I felt lighter afterward.   I’ve been doing it twice a week, and I think it’s helping me feel more grounded.   Yes, I feel a bit more centered, especially when work gets hectic.   Sometimes I forget to do the mindfulness exercises, especially on busy days.   I’ve written a few pages, but I feel like I’m still finding my voice.   Sometimes I think, “Who am I to write?”   I try to remind myself that everyone starts somewhere and that my voice matters.   I had a moment with a friend where I reacted too quickly, and I felt bad afterward.   I apologized, and we talked it out. It felt good to clear the air.   I am trying to be more conscious of my words and actions.   I feel good about them. I’ve been making an effort to stay connected with my family and friends.   I think I’d like to spend more time with my sisters. We used to be closer, and I miss that.  "
