History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey Ellie! I’ve been okay, I guess. Still trying to get through the days.  I understand. You mentioned feeling pretty low last time. Have you noticed any changes in your mood since then? Not really. It’s like I’m stuck in this rut. I still feel blah most of the time. I try to keep busy, but it’s hard. That makes sense. Keeping busy can sometimes help, but it sounds like you might still be feeling overwhelmed. Have you had a chance to write at all since we last spoke? Not really. I keep thinking about it, but I just can’t seem to get the words down. I feel like I’m losing that spark. That’s understandable, especially if you’re feeling low. What do you think is holding you back from writing? I think it’s just that I don’t feel inspired. Like, I have ideas, but I can’t get excited about them. It’s frustrating. Last time, you mentioned feeling angry about people who don’t seem to help themselves. Have you noticed any situations that have triggered that anger lately? Yeah, actually. I was at a grocery store and saw someone begging outside. It just made me so mad. I wanted to shout at them to get a job. I guess I just don’t understand why some people don’t try harder. I’ve had my struggles, but I’ve always tried to make things work. Great! Let’s start by discussing your own struggles. You mentioned having a gambling addiction. How do you think that experience influences your views on responsibility? Well, I know I messed up, but I always tried to get back on my feet. I guess I just feel like if I can do it, others should too."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Great! One technique that might help is free writing. It’s where you write without worrying about grammar or structure—just let your thoughts flow. Have you ever tried that? Would you be interested in trying some mindfulness exercises? They can be helpful for calming your mind before sleep. Great! I can share a simple breathing exercise with you. It’s just focusing on your breath, inhaling for four counts, holding for four, and exhaling for four. "
Next Steps,"It can be liberating! You could set a timer for ten minutes and just write whatever comes to mind. Would you be open to trying that this week? Sure, I can give that a shot.  That makes sense. Maybe I’ll try it tonight. Perfect! How about we check in on that in our next session?  Maybe. I’ve thought about volunteering or something, but I never follow through. That could be a great outlet for you! It might help you feel more connected to your community and give you a sense of purpose. Would you like to explore some volunteer opportunities together? Yeah, I’d be open to that. Wonderful! We can look into it next time. For now, how about focusing on your writing and seeing how that goes?  Perfect! Let’s try to incorporate that into your bedtime routine and see if it helps.  I’ll give it a go. I’m glad to hear that. Thank you for sharing today. Let’s check in on your writing and sleep techniques next session. "
