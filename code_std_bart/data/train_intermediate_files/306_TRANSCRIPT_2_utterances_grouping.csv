History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hi Ellie! I’ve been trying to practice mindfulness, like we discussed. It’s been a bit of a challenge, but I’m getting there. I think it’s just remembering to take those moments for myself. I get so caught up in work and other responsibilities. I’ve noticed that I can do it during my breaks at work. It helps me reset a bit. I think so. I feel a bit less overwhelmed when I take those moments to breathe. I’ve started journaling! It’s been nice to get my thoughts out on paper. Mostly about my feelings regarding work and my daughter. It helps me see things more clearly. Yes, I keep coming back to my worries about being a good parent and my anxiety about work. Yes, I think I need to. I want to be a supportive parent, but sometimes I feel like I’m not doing enough. I guess being emotionally available and supportive. I just don’t want to overstep or make her feel like I’m judging her. I haven’t, but it sounds like a good idea. I just worry I’ll come off as overbearing. I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with deadlines and expectations. I worry that I won’t meet them. I haven’t really tried that. I usually just dive in and hope for the best. I’ll try to remember that. I tend to overlook my accomplishments."

Next Steps,"I could try that. Maybe in the morning before I start my day? You’re right. I’ll try to have that conversation soon. Breaking tasks into smaller, more achievable steps can help reduce anxiety. You could create a to-do list and prioritize what needs to be done first. That sounds helpful. I’ll give it a shot. Great! Remember to celebrate small victories as you complete tasks. It can help boost your confidence."
