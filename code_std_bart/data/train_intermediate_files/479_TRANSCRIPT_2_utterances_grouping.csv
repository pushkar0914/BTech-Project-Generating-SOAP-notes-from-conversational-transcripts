History of Present Illness (HPI),"I did some research on personal training, but I didn’t get to the mindfulness or budgeting.  There are a lot of certifications, and some seem really expensive.  Yeah, there’s one that’s online and not too pricey.  How about the mindfulness breathing? Did you give it a try?  I forgot most nights.  I didn’t do that either.  They were pretty high.  Just work stuff and thinking about money.  Have you noticed any physical symptoms when you feel stressed?  I get headaches sometimes.  I’ve been working out, but it doesn’t always help. "

Next Steps,"That’s a great start! Would you like to set a goal to enroll in that course?  I think I could do that.  Excellent! How about we aim for next week?  Sure.  That’s okay! It can be challenging to remember to do something new. Would setting a reminder help?  Yeah, probably.  No worries. Would it help to start with just one meal a week where you limit spending?  That sounds better.  Perfect! Let’s say one meal out this week.  Okay.  How about a simple, “Hey, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work and finances”?  I could try that.  It sounds like you’re doing your best. Have you considered talking to a doctor about your headaches?  It might be worth it, especially if they’re frequent.  Yeah, I’ll think about it.  As we wrap up today, what are your goals for next week?  I want to enroll in the personal training course, set a meal budget, and try the mindfulness again. "
