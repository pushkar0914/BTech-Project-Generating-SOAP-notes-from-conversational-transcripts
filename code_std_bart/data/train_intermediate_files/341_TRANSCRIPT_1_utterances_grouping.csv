History of Present Illness (HPI),"It made me happy too. It’s nice to see them enjoying themselves, especially with everything going on. I can imagine. Last time, you mentioned feeling a bit overwhelmed with parenting. Have those feelings changed at all? I think I’m getting better at it, but some days are definitely harder than others. Yeah, he seems more confident. It’s like he’s realizing he can do things, even if they’re challenging. Well, I still struggle with my mom. She keeps pushing me to do things her way, and it frustrates me. I try to stay calm, but sometimes I just snap. It’s hard to keep my cool when she doesn’t respect my choices. She might be defensive at first, but I think she’ll come around eventually. I’ve looked into some online courses, but I’m worried about balancing everything."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I’ve been trying to focus on the positives more. Like, I remind myself that my son is doing his best, and so am I. I try to celebrate the little victories. Like when my son learns something new, I make a big deal out of it. That’s understandable. It can be challenging when someone close to us doesn’t validate our decisions. Would you like to explore some coping strategies for those situations? One strategy could be to set boundaries. Have you thought about what boundaries you might want to establish with her? I guess I could tell her that I need her to trust my decisions as a parent. It’s great that you have hope for that. Would you like to practice how you might approach that conversation? That’s a positive step. Remember, it’s about expressing your needs while also being empathetic to her concerns.  It’s understandable to feel that way. Perhaps we can work on a plan to help you manage your time effectively. That’s a great idea! Planning can help reduce anxiety about fitting everything in. "
Next Steps,"Let’s set some realistic goals for you. How many hours a week do you think you could dedicate to studying? Maybe three to four hours? I could do a couple of evenings after the kids are in bed. That sounds reasonable. What about creating a schedule to keep track of your study times? I could definitely try that. I’m a bit of a planner, so it might help me stay organized."
