History of Present Illness (HPI),"Hey! I’ve been pretty good. I actually reached out to a few venues about open mic nights. I got a couple of responses, and I’m thinking about performing next week! I’m a little nervous, but mostly I’m just stoked to share my music. I’ve been writing a lot more. I feel like I’m finding my voice. I’ve been thinking about recording some of my songs and putting them online. I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything going on."
Medical and Psychiatric History,Nothing reported
Psychosocial History,"I’m trying to write about my experiences and how they shape me. Like, the ups and downs of life. I hope they’ll see that it’s okay to struggle and that they’re not alone in it. Yeah, I want to inspire others through my art. Just balancing music, friends, and everything else. Sometimes it feels like too much. I think I need to learn to say no sometimes. I don’t want to let anyone down, but I can’t do it all. It’s hard for me, but I know I need to try."
Risk Assessment,"I guess I’m just worried about how it’ll be received. True! I just need to push through that fear, I guess."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I think just reminding myself that it’s all about having fun and connecting with people. Yeah, I’ve been doing more breathing exercises. They help a lot. For sure. I’ve also been trying to visualize the performance going well. It feels good. It makes me believe that I can do it."
Next Steps,"Maybe I can set aside some time this week to work on recording a demo. Yeah, I’ll do it. I want to make it happen. Yeah, that makes sense. I’ll give it a shot."
