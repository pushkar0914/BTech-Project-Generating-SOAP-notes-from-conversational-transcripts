Therapeutic Interventions,"Yeah, I’ve been doing some light stretching and breathing exercises. It helps a bit. It might be helpful to find a constructive outlet for that anger. Some people find it useful to write about their feelings or even engage in physical activity to release pent-up energy. What do you think? Writing could be good. I’ve never really tried that before."
Next Steps,"Yeah, I can try writing about it. Of course! I’m here to help you navigate these feelings. Let’s set a goal for writing about your feelings and checking in on your sleep routine for next week."
