History of Present Illness (HPI),oh wow um and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just hm and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days
Medical and Psychiatric History,uh i have a few different degrees that was fun and i also have a masters uh degree in economics it was something that i wanted to do and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from but i think i function why'd you decide to enlist in the military i didn't enlist i was an officer that um seventeen i started when after high school and i went to a service academy did you ever see combat uh we did just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just at the time it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh what did you do after the military uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school and i got two graduate degrees didn't care for it have you been diagnosed with depression and i wasn't able to really function do you feel like therapy is useful i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous do you still go to therapy now uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off
Psychosocial History,i was born and raised in los angeles and i'm one of the few locals from around here but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles i like the weather having owned a vacation house in another state that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here um i like the culture i like the diversity i like the familiarity i like that beaches uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and uh i think it's a great place to live things i don't like about l_a or say california in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations i'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated and uh that's a big problem here in uh uh california it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what makes our taxes uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries i don't travel as much as i used to but i've traveled quite a bit and i've learned a couple of languages and uh i've been all through europe eastern europe asia south america north africa 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and uh i try to eat healthy and uh sure um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping but really having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh nice with the french where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports are you still working in that um i'm actually in the wholesale business now for wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago and it's pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it hm uh aw you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids yeah tell me about your relationship with your family um well both my parents are recently uh deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away and we're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting and uh i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family all so uh yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but how did serving in the military change you well it made me more patriotic having grown up in california whereas people who are from all over the country and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i ended up becoming uh just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or unlike so many of my friends that for a number of years and oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about how would your best friend describe you i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational i'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go uh you know people also say i'm a lot of fun i'm fun to be with is there anything you regret probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices what are you most proud of in your life um i'm proud of my daughter she's a nice young lady i am uh proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my um there are very few people like me who did it had the background in education that i did but i like public service so i'm proud of uh that  proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees sort of like trophies
Risk Assessment,Nothing reported
Mental Health Observations,do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable i think i'm more of an extrovert whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted and be more um introverted it uh i usually find exercise helps me relax the best that was it but that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years yeah how are you at controlling your temper you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now um but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it how did you feel in that moment i felt like i was talking to a wall how have you been feeling lately i feel pretty good lately you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but no not really how has seeing a therapist affected you talking to someone who has a lot more life experience tell me about the last time you felt really happy i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and and i have a bunch of errands to run and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out where i always i know that term so so that's pretty much but just a lot of it's very typical what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now
