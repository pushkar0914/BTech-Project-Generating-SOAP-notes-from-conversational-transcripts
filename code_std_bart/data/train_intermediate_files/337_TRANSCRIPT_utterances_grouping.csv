History of Present Illness (HPI),the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her  and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process  but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it  
Medical and Psychiatric History,no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if i mean i wound up having to take more medication uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't they eh they actually got me up and so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   i have a family to look after now  you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm  
Psychosocial History,i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean there's not that much i don't like i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know i'd rather keep to myself uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together  somewhat close i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter> xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just   sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway so i i like i like doing that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed   probably that i can think on my feet and hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  strive for balance  that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to  who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is  yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now
Risk Assessment,uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works  but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore
