Trauma History,uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child
Substance Use History,Nothing reported
History of Present Illness (HPI),and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i um i don't really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression
Medical and Psychiatric History,uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling
Psychosocial History,uh north carolina uh almost four years ago um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there l_a's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going home's like going back to see my family and i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media studies and production uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now i do um i love traveling i try to uh go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently and i'm planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world i'm very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy cooking um uh my <m> my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very uh sad obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i um i was on a my uh aw yeah i know i <laughter> i love her she's great um she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see you for five days and then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have <sigh> i guess for xxx i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm

Physiological Observations,um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so

Therapeutic Interventions,but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis
