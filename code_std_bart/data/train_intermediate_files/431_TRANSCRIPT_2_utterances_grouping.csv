History of Present Illness (HPI),"I’ve been okay, still navigating some feelings about my mom. Thanks for sharing that. Last time, we set a goal to explore your feelings of guilt. Have you had any new insights? I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I feel guilty but also relieved to have some distance. Maybe by accepting that I needed space but still recognizing my love for her. Yes, when I see happy families, I remind myself that my situation is different. A little, but it’s still awkward. It feels empowering! I’d feel disappointed, but I could remind myself I’m doing what’s best for me. Yes, they’ve been a bit more rebellious lately, and it’s stressing me out. They’re arguing more and not listening to me. Not yet, I’m worried it might escalate things."

Therapeutic Interventions,"I think I need to limit our conversations to lighter topics for now. I’d say, “Hi, how are you?” and keep it friendly. I’d say something like, “I’d prefer to talk about something lighter today.” A good starting point might be expressing your feelings first. For example, “I feel worried when I see you arguing.” How does that sound? “Hey, can we talk for a minute? I’ve been feeling worried about how we’ve been interacting lately.”"
Next Steps,"I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress. For our next session, we can continue to explore your relationship with your mom and your parenting challenges. "
