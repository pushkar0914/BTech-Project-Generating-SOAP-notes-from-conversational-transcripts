History of Present Illness (HPI),"That's understandable. Last time, we talked about your feelings regarding your kids and the challenges of being away from them. Have you had any thoughts about that since we last spoke? Yeah, I think about them a lot. I still feel guilty about not being there for them. It sounds like that guilt is weighing heavily on you. Have you found any ways to cope with those feelings? I've tried to distract myself, but sometimes it just creeps back in. Those sound like good strategies. Have you been able to connect with your kids at all, even if it’s just through a phone call or video chat? A few times, but it’s hard. I feel like I'm not really there for them, you know? Maybe if I could visit them or if they could come here. But that’s not really possible right now. I think they’d appreciate it, but I worry they might feel sad too. I guess that makes sense. I just don’t want to burden them with my problems. Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels since our last session? I still feel stressed, especially about work and money. I’ve tried listening to music more, but I still feel overwhelmed sometimes. Just the usual worries, but I feel a bit better talking about it."

Therapeutic Interventions,"Music can be a great outlet. Have you considered trying mindfulness or meditation to help ground yourself? Would you be open to exploring some mindfulness exercises together? Great! One simple technique is focusing on your breath. Let’s try it together. Take a deep breath in, hold it for a moment, and then slowly exhale.  That’s wonderful to hear. Practicing this for a few minutes each day might help you manage stress better. How does that sound?"
Next Steps,"I could try to call them more often or send them little gifts.  That sounds doable. I’ll give it a try. Perfect! Let’s check in on your goals for the week. Would you like to set a goal around connecting with your kids and practicing mindfulness? Yeah, I think I can do that.  How about aiming to call your kids at least once this week and practice mindfulness for a few minutes each day? That sounds reasonable."
