History of Present Illness (HPI),in the past i've had problems but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter> ah probably argued with my roommate <psh> couple days ago but uh that happens we're friends uh it's a loving argument <laughter> if if you will i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly cared about but knowing knowing that it just wasn't going to work um that was very difficult just weighed pros and cons and just thought it just wasn't going to work um no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship there was something missing and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and just knew it was over the same girl that i broke up with she was the she was a girlfriend <laughter> of uh a a best friend of mine and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we do not speak i wish uh my regret is i wish i i would've handled that better i think uh i always knew there was a problem there was some issue emotionally and hmm and lot of things that are very hard to explain and i just was tired of feeling that way so i sought help lethargy uh uh no desire to do anything uh motivation just was wasn't there think normal depression type things uh social <socia> i became socially awkward which was a little bit different for me 'cause uh growing up i was you know quite talkative <laughter>
